Still non-consecutive (20 sections):
Cross-chapter (Scripture, Summary, Patience, Abandoning objections, etc.) – these sections cite verses from multiple chapters by design.
Within-chapter gaps (e.g. 3.11 vs 3.13–15, 5.84 vs 5.91–97) – the overview may need finer structure in the mapping.
Likely overview gaps (e.g. 1.1/1.3 with 1.2 elsewhere) – source structure or overview coverage may need to be updated.
If you want, we can target a specific remaining section for further fixes.
