ANSWER: d
VERSE REF(S): 1.48, 1.49, 1.50
VERSE TEXT:
[1.48] Arising from existence is not logical,
Nor is arising from nonexistence, like a skyflower.
Consequently both are errors.
Therefore there is no arising from both, either.
[1.49] Objects do not arise from self,
Nor from other, nor from both,
Nor without cause, because of which,
They have no intrinsic nature.
[1.50] Or, if all dharmas
Are analysed for singularity and multiplicity,
Since no essence is seen,
It is certain they have no intrinsic nature.

ANSWER: c
VERSE REF(S): 1.50
VERSE TEXT:
[1.50] Or, if all dharmas
Are analysed for singularity and multiplicity,
Since no essence is seen,
It is certain they have no intrinsic nature.

Q118. Why does Atiśa say wisdom itself must also be subject to analysis?
a) To ensure that one's understanding is correct
b) To develop sharper analytical skills
c) Because even wisdom has no intrinsic nature — just as one does not see intrinsic nature in all dharmas, so wisdom too must be analysed
d) Because some people mistake conceptual understanding for wisdom
ANSWER: c
VERSE REF(S): 1.54
VERSE TEXT:
[1.54] Just as one with wisdom does not see
Any intrinsic nature in all dharmas,
So wisdom itself is subject to analysis.
One should meditate without any concepts.

Sky-like non-discrimination will be revealed.'

a) Diligence alone is sufficient regardless of conditions
b) Both proper conditions and diligence are necessary — diligence without proper conditions, even for thousands of years, will not suffice
c) Conditions alone are sufficient regardless of diligence
d) Neither conditions nor diligence matter if one has received empowerment
ANSWER: b
VERSE REF(S): 1.39, 1.40
VERSE TEXT:
[1.39] While the conditions of calm abiding are weak,
Even to meditate with strong diligence
For thousands of years
Will not accomplish samādhi.
[1.40] Therefore, maintain well the conditions
Taught in the Tract on the Accumulation of Samādhi.
Place the mind in virtue
On any suitable object of attention.

ANSWER: d
VERSE REF(S): 1.41, 1.42
VERSE TEXT:
[1.41] When the yogin attains calm abiding,
The higher knowledges are attained also.
Yet without the yoga of the perfection of wisdom,
The obscurations will not be exhausted.
[1.42] Therefore, in order to abandon completely
The obscurations of defilements and cognition,
Cultivate the perfection of wisdom
Always in conjunction with skilful means.

c) They would be excommunicated from the saṅgha
d) Their meditation would become unstable
ANSWER: b
VERSE REF(S): 1.65, 1.66
VERSE TEXT:
[1.65] Should these empowerments be received
By those keeping the discipline of pure conduct,
Because its conduct has been forbidden,
Their vows of discipline would be broken.
[1.66] This would be a defeat
Of the discipline they were holding and a downfall,
And since they would be sure to fall into the lower realms,
They could not attain siddhis.
