    "In the language of India: Bodhipathapradīpa. In Tibetan: byang chub lam gyi sgron ma [Lamp of the Path to Enlightenment].",
    "I bow down to the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta.",
    "To all the Conquerors of the three times, their dharma,\nAnd the saṅgha, I pay homage with great devotion.\nAt the urging of my good disciple Changchub-O,\nI will shine a lamp of the path to enlightenment.",
    "Lesser, intermediate and supreme:\nThus the Three Persons are to be known.\nI shall write to clarify the distinctions\nBetween each of their natures.",
    "Someone using methods by which\nThey pursue, for their own good,\nMere saṃsāric happiness,\nShould be known as inferior.",
    "Someone who turns away from conditioned happiness\nAnd desists from nonvirtuous actions,\nSeeking only their own individual peace,\nShould be called an intermediate person.",
    "Someone who, by their own suffering,\nTruly wishes to completely end\nAll the sufferings of others\nIs a superior person.",
    "For those excellent beings\nWho want supreme enlightenment,\nI will now explain the authentic means\nWhich has been taught by the lamas.",
    "Before an image of the perfect Buddha,\nA stupa, and the holy dharma,\nMake offerings with whatever you have—\nFlowers, incense, materials etc.",
    "With the seven point offering taught in\nSamanthabhadra’s Prayer for Good Conduct,\nUntil one’s destination, the heart of enlightenment, is reached,\nWith the pure intention never to stop,",
    "Have strong faith in the Three Jewels\nAnd, placing one knee on the ground,\nWith one’s palms together,\nBegin by going for refuge three times.",
    "Then, a loving intention towards\nAll sentient beings is the preliminary\nTo looking upon all beings, without exception,\nSuffering throughout the three lower realms,\nBirth, death, transmigration etc.",
    "And wishing to set them free\nFrom the sufferings that torment them,\nFrom suffering, suffering, and its cause.\nOne should generate bodhicitta,\nWhich is an irreversible commitment.",
    "That is the pure mind of aspiration.\nThe qualities of developing it\nHave been well explained by Maitreya\nIn the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra.",
    "One should read the sūtras or hear them from the lama,\nFor truly to understand the limitless qualities of the mind of perfect enlightenment\nWill cause its stabilisation.\nAgain and again develop the intention in this way.",
    "In the Sūtra of Vīradatta’s Questions\nIts merit is explained fully.\nThere, in just three of its verses,\nIt is summarised, which I will now quote.",
    "“What merit there is in bodhicitta,\nIf it could have form,\nWould fill the realms of space,\nAnd overflow even from this.”",
    "“However many grains of sand there may be in\nThe Ganges, as many Buddha fields\nCould be completely filled with gems\nAnd offered by someone to the lords of the world,”",
    "“But, if someone folds their hands\nWith devotion for enlightenment,\nTheir veneration is superior,\nFor there is no limit to that.”",
    "Having developed true aspiration bodhicitta,\nOne should always increase it with all kinds of exertion.\nIn order to remember this as well in other lives,\nMaintain assiduously the trainings just as they are explained.",
    "Unless one holds the vow of application bodhicitta,\nAspiration will not develop to perfection.\nThose wishing to increase the vow of perfect enlightenment\nShould definitely make effort to take this vow.",
    "Apart from always holding\nThe seven kinds of prātimokṣa,\nThe good fortune of this bodhisattva vow\nIs not to be found anywhere.",
    "Among the seven kinds of prātimokṣa\nExplained by the Tathāgata,\nThe glorious Brahmā conduct is supreme.\nThe vows of the bhikṣu are to be known thus.",
    "One should know the excellent lama\nTo be learned in the ritual of the vow,\nTo be someone who keeps the vow,\nAnd to consent to bestow the vow with compassion.",
    "Using the ritual taught in the chapter\nOn moral discipline in the Bodhisattvabhūmi,\nTake the vow from the excellent lama\nWho possesses the requisite characteristics.",
    "For one who has tried but been unable\nTo find such a qualified lama,\nI shall properly explain another ritual\nTo take the vow.",
    "In a past age, Mañjuśrī,\nWhen he was Ambarāja,\nGenerated bodhicitta in the way\nThat is taught in the sūtra of\nThe Ornament of Mañjuśrī’s Buddha Realm,\nAs I shall now relate here in full.",
    "“In the presence of the Protectors,\nI generate perfect bodhicitta.\nInviting all beings as my guests,\nI will liberate them from saṃsāra.”",
    "“From now until I have attained\nPerfect enlightenment, I will cease\nIntentions of harm, aggression,\nGreed and envy.”",
    "“I will practise pure conduct\nAnd abandon nonvirtue and desire.\nTaking joy in the vow of conduct,\nI will train following the Buddhas.”",
    "“Taking no pleasure in swiftly\nAttaining enlightenment for myself,\nI will remain until the end\nFor even a single being.”",
    "“I will utterly purify\nInconceivable fields without limit.\nFor those who remember my name,\nI will remain for them throughout the ten directions.”",
    "“I will purify entirely\nActions of body and speech.\nI will purify the activity of mind too,\nAnd I will cease nonvirtuous actions.”",
    "If one keeps the vow of application bodhicitta,\nIt is the cause of complete purification of body, speech, and mind.\nIf the moral conduct of the three trainings is properly practised,\nDevotion to the moral conduct of the three trainings will grow greater.",
    "Therefore, intent upon pure and perfect enlightenment,\nBodhisattvas will keep the vow of vows pure.\nThey will endeavour in perfect enlightenment\nAnd completely fulfill the accumulations.",
    "The cause of completely perfecting the accumulations,\nThe natures of which are merit and wisdom,\nIs held by all the Buddhas\nTo be the development of the higher knowledges.",
    "Just as a bird with unfledged wings\nCannot fly in the sky,\nSo, without the power of the higher knowledges,\nOne cannot benefit beings.",
    "Whatever merit may be obtained in a single day\nBy someone endowed with the higher knowledges,\nWill not be obtained in a hundred lifetimes\nBy someone who lacks them.",
    "Those who want to complete swiftly\nThe accumulations of perfect enlightenment\nWill accomplish the higher knowledges\nNot through laziness but through effort.",
    "Since without achieving calm abiding\nThe higher knowledges will not arise,\nOne should apply oneself again and again\nIn trying to accomplish calm abiding.",
    "While the conditions of calm abiding are weak,\nEven to meditate with strong diligence\nFor thousands of years\nWill not accomplish samādhi.",
    "Therefore, maintain well the conditions\nTaught in the Tract on the Accumulation of Samādhi.\nPlace the mind in virtue\nOn any suitable object of attention.",
    "When the yogin attains calm abiding,\nThe higher knowledges are attained also.\nYet without the yoga of the perfection of wisdom,\nThe obscurations will not be exhausted.",
    "Therefore, in order to abandon completely\nThe obscurations of defilements and cognition,\nCultivate the perfection of wisdom\nAlways in conjunction with skilful means.",
    "Wisdom without skilful means\nAnd skilful means without wisdom\nWere said to be prisons.\nDo not therefore abandon either of them.",
    "To eliminate doubts concerning\nWhat ‘wisdom’ and ‘skilful means’ are,\nI will now clarify the correct distinction\nBetween skilful means and wisdom.",
    "Apart from the perfection of wisdom,\nAll virtuous dharmas,\nSuch as the perfection of giving,\nWere taught by the Conquerors to be skilful means.",
    "Whoever cultivates wisdom\nThrough the power of cultivating skilful means\nWill soon attain enlightenment\nBut, by cultivating non-self alone, will not.",
    "The skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanās\nAre to be understood as being without arising.\nThis recognition of the emptiness of intrinsic nature\nIs the definition of ‘wisdom’.",
    "Arising from existence is not logical,\nNor is arising from nonexistence, like a skyflower.\nConsequently both are errors.\nTherefore there is no arising from both, either.",
    "Objects do not arise from self,\nNor from other, nor from both,\nNor without cause, because of which,\nThey have no intrinsic nature.",
    "Or, if all dharmas\nAre analysed for singularity and multiplicity,\nSince no essence is seen,\nIt is certain they have no intrinsic nature.",
    "The arguments of the Seventy Verses on Emptiness,\nThe Root Verses on the Middle Way and so forth,\nShow the proofs for the emptiness\nOf the intrinsic nature of things.",
    "Because this text would become too long,\nI will not elaborate on them here,\nBut I have fully explained just the established tenets\nFor the purpose of meditation.",
    "Therefore, whoever meditates upon non-self\nWithout seeing an intrinsic nature\nOf any dharma whatsoever\nIs meditating upon wisdom.",
    "Just as one with wisdom does not see\nAny intrinsic nature in all dharmas,\nSo wisdom itself is subject to analysis.\nOne should meditate without any concepts.",
    "This world comes from conceptual discrimination.\nIts very core is conceptual discrimination.\nTherefore, abandon such discrimination entirely.\nThat is the supreme nirvāṇa.",
    "Thus the Bhagavān said,\n‘Conceptual discrimination is the great ignorance.\nIt plunges one into the ocean of saṃsāra.\nResting in non-discriminating samādhi,\nSky-like non-discrimination will be revealed.’",
    "In the Dhāraṇī of Entering into Non-discrimination Sūtra it likewise says,\n‘Should sons of the Conquerors meditate upon\nThis sacred teaching of non-discrimination,\nThey will escape the struggles of discrimination,\nAnd gradually achieve non-discrimination.’",
    "With scriptures and reasoning,\nHaving made certain that all dharmas\nAre nonarising, without intrinsic nature,\nMeditate without discrimination.",
    "Thus if one meditates upon suchness\nAnd attains the successive stages of heat etc.,\nThen one will attain the Joyful bhūmi and the rest,\nAnd the enlightenment of a Buddha will not be far off.",
    "With activities such as pacifying and increasing,\nAnd also with powers such as the eight great attainments,\nLike the excellent vase attainment,\nWhich are accomplished through the power of mantra,",
    "If one wishes to fulfil completely with ease\nThe accumulations of enlightenment,\nAnd if one wishes for the conduct of the secret mantras\nTaught in Kriyā, Caryā etc. tantras,",
    "Then, for the ācārya empowerment,\nOne should please the holy lama with all one has,\nSuch as with veneration and with gifts, such as jewels,\nAnd by accomplishing his instructions.",
    "The one who pleases the lama\nWill perfectly receive the ācārya empowerment.\nAll of one’s nonvirtues will be utterly purified\nAnd one will become worthy of accomplishing siddhis.",
    "Because the great Paramādibuddha tantra\nExpressly forbids it,\nThose observing pure conduct\nShould not receive the secret and wisdom empowerments.",
    "Should these empowerments be received\nBy those keeping the discipline of pure conduct,\nBecause its conduct has been forbidden,\nTheir vows of discipline would be broken.",
    "This would be a defeat\nOf the discipline they were holding and a downfall,\nAnd since they would be sure to fall into the lower realms,\nThey could not attain siddhis.",
    "Hearing and explaining all the tantras,\nPerforming fire pūjās, offerings, and so forth,\nAre not faults for those who have received\nThe ācārya empowerment and know thusness.",
    "Upon the supplication of Changchub-O,\nI, the Sthavira Dīpaṃkaraśrī,\nHave given this brief explanation of the path to enlightenment,\nAs I have seen it explained in teachings such as the sūtras.",
    "The Lamp of the Path to Enlightenment, composed by the great ācārya Dīpaṃkara Śrījñāna is completed.",
    "It was translated and checked by the great master of India himself and the great translator and editor, Gewa'i Lodro."
