[0.1]
Section (2.1): Title [LPE-2.1]
In the language of India: Bodhipathapradīpa. In Tibetan: byang chub lam gyi sgron ma [Lamp of the Path to Enlightenment].

[0.2]
Section (2.2): Translator’s homage [LPE-2.2]
I bow down to the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta.

[1.1]
Section (2.3.1): Homage and commitment to compose [LPE-2.3.1]
What are the objects to which one should pay homage at the beginning of writing a śāstra?

[1.2]
Section (2.3.2.1): Analytical summary of the Three Persons [LPE-2.3.2.1]
How is the path to enlightenment that is referenced in the expression ‘I will shine the lamp of the path to enlightenment’ to be explained? Although the term ‘person’ generally indicates a sentient being, here it is synonymous with the Sanskrit term ‘puruṣa’, which signifies engaging in a function or ability. In this context, the term ‘person’ means possessing the ability to accomplish the benefit of future lives. One could also use the term ‘human’ to indicate having a discriminating intellect that is able to discern what to accept and reject for the benefit of future lives. One whose purposes are solely concerned with this life is not therefore what is meant by the terms ‘person’ or ‘human’ in this context.

[1.3]
Section (2.3.2.2.1): Characteristics of the lesser person’s path [LPE-2.3.2.2.1]
This is the path of someone who is able to accomplish their own benefit for the next life and beyond, without attachment to this life as their main concern. Concerning the methods for doing this, having previously developed conviction in karmic causes and results, this person adopts the moral discipline of abandoning the ten nonvirtuous actions, and cultivates the conditioned meditative absorptions, formless meditative absorptions and so forth, known as the ‘Deva-yāna’ or ‘Brahmā-yāna’. By the use of such methods they pursue, for their own good, the happiness of the highest stage of human existence—the universal emperor—and the mere saṃsāric happiness from the level of Indra up to the realms of formlessness. Such a person disregards the benefit of others and pursues conditioned existence, and so is inferior to the intermediate and great person. Thus they should be known as inferior in the context of this teaching. Although in general there are also inferior people who pursue merely the benefits of this life, this too requires engagement in the proper methods of temporal happiness, no different to the inferior person mentioned here.

[1.4]
Section (2.3.2.2.2): Characteristics of the intermediate person’s path [LPE-2.3.2.2.2]
By contemplating the innumerable ways in which the entirety of cyclic existence, from the unendurable hell realm to the peak of conditioned existence, is characterised by suffering, one will have no desire for the happiness even of universal emperors, kings and so forth, even in one’s dreams. One will turn away from all forms of conditioned happiness and feel only revulsion for them. This is the contemplative principle of the intermediate path. Motivated by this contemplation, one will desist from nonvirtuous actions of body, speech and mind, perfectly maintaining the discipline of whichever one of the seven kinds of prātimokṣa precepts is appropriate. This is the practical principle. On the basis of both the contemplative and practical principles, someone who seeks nirvāṇa, which is the total pacification of all suffering, only for their own individual self, has the principle of the result. Having these three principles, by entering the path of unerringly practising the holy dharma, one becomes the kind of person referred to in this verse.

[1.5]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.1): Brief summary [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.1]
An individual who has thoroughly trained their mind on the paths of the lesser and intermediate persons and perfected those trainings will see that throughout the beginning, middle and end, their existence is afflicted by their own saṃsāric suffering. When such a person contemplates the sufferings of all other sentient beings as if they were his or her own mothers, thinking of them drifting through an ocean of conditioned existence characterised by such suffering, they become motivated by a compassion which cannot bear that all such beings are tortured, like themselves, by the flames of all these sufferings. Such a person truly wishes to completely end all of those sufferings, as well as their causes—the two obscurations together with their karmic imprints—utterly and irreversibly. This is someone who has the precious intention to achieve enlightenment with an accompanying wish to work for the benefit of others and, with this motivation, maintains the various kinds of bodhisattva conduct. Since they enter into the inerrant means of accomplishing the Mahāyāna, they have the superior or great characteristics mentioned in this verse.

[1.6]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.1): The commitment to explain [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.1]
The expression ‘I will now explain’ indicates the forthcoming explanation. What is going to be explained? The indispensable means for achieving unsurpassed enlightenment. Who is the explanation for? It is for those excellent beings who are of the awakened Mahāyāna family and who have the completely pure motivation of wanting to attain the level of supreme enlightenment for the benefit of others. What kind of explanation is it? It is one without personal fabrication, i.e. it follows that which has been taught by holy lamas such as the Noble Lord himself and his teacher Serlingpa and, since it possesses scriptural authority and reasoning, is authentic. The first two lines identify the vessel for whom the dharma is given. The last two lines identify the nectar-like dharma itself. Furthermore:

[1.7] [1.8]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.1): Gathering the accumulations [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.1]
Before which objects should one make offerings? A representation of the perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, such as a painted image, bas-relief, or moulded statue as a support of his kāya, a stupa housing relics as a support of his mind, and a text of the holy dharma comprising the twelve scriptural branches etc. as a support of his speech. Having situated oneself directly before these objects, one should make offerings. Geshe Sharawa has taught that one should also make prostrations.

[1.9]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.2): The act of going for special refuge [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.2]
The specific duration for special refuge is until one’s destination, the heart of enlightenment, is reached, i.e. for as long as one has not attained the dharmakāya. The heart of enlightenment has two aspects: a domain and realisation. There are two domains of the heart of enlightenment—the vajra seat of the nirmāṇakāya, and the Densely Arrayed Akaniṣṭha Buddha field of the saṃbhogakāya. The omniscient master Buton described the realisation of the heart of enlightenment as ‘the unsurpassed primordial wisdom of the dharmakāya’.

[1.10] [1.11abc]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.3): Training the mind [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.3]
After one has completed the act of special refuge, which precedes the gathering of the accumulations, then it is necessary to have a loving intention which considers all sentient beings as one’s own mothers, for this is the preliminary practice which is the true cause of compassion, being among the seven sequential instructions on cause and effect,8 as follows. By means of i) recognising all sentient beings as one’s mothers, ii) remembering their kindness, and iii) having gratitude for their kindness, an unstable feeling of iv) love and kindness arises. Then one meditates on v) compassion, thinking of their intense suffering throughout the three lower realms and how long that lasts for; of the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death etc. that afflict humans; of the sufferings of death, transmigration and falling below, which afflict the desire realm gods; and, among the gods of the form and formless levels, one thinks of the sufferings of intoxication by meditative stability, due to which they have no interest in dharma, and thus their meditative stability does not grant them liberation.

[1.11de]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.2): The main practice [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.2]
Having thoroughly developed the feelings of loving kindness and compassion in this way, by means of making an irreversible commitment never to turn away from the precious mind of enlightenment, one should generate the precious bodhicitta.

[1.12]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1): Training in remembering the benefits [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1]
That which was explained above is the pure mind of aspiration bodhicitta. The qualities or benefits of developing it through a ritual are limitless. As it says in the Noble Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra,

[1.13] [1.14] [1.15] [1.16] [1.17]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.2): Training in the cultivation of bodhicitta [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.2]
The one for whom bodhicitta has been engendered in the ritual of aspiration bodhicitta referred to above should read the sūtras and śāstras or, alternatively, properly hear them from the lama. There are limitless and immeasurable qualities or benefits of the aspiring mind which is intent upon perfect enlightenment. These are taught in the basket of Mahāyāna sūtras, etc. and so they should be truly understood without uncertainties from such sources. The purpose of doing so is that it will cause or bring about the stabilisation and unimpeded strengthening of that intention in one’s stream of being. Thus one should again and again develop the intention of bodhicitta in this way, at least three times each day and three times each night.

[1.18ab]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.3): Training in gathering the two accumulations [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.3]
By means of remembering the benefits and the training as explained in the previous two sections, one will develop true aspiration bodhicitta. Having done so, one should gather the accumulation of merit by such means as making offerings to the Three Jewels, offering service and respect to the saṅgha, giving tormas to spirits and giving alms to the poor. One should also gather the accumulation of primordial wisdom. Thus it is essential to make all kinds of such exertion, so that the intention of bodhicitta should always be increased.

[1.18cd]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.5): Training in accepting and rejecting black and white dharmas [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.5]
Having taken this ritual of aspiration bodhicitta referred to above, one should maintain assiduously the trainings in the white and black dharmas just as they are explained.

[1.19]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.1): Connecting aspiration with the vow of application bodhicitta [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.1]
Although one might generate bodhicitta in this way, if one does not train in the conduct of the Conquerors’ sons, enlightenment is impossible. Also, if one does not take the bodhisattva vow, then even if one trains in giving and so forth, that would not constitute the conduct of the Conquerors’ sons. Therefore for someone who has stabilised aspiration bodhicitta by the ritual of the vow, it is necessary to then take the vow which is the basis of conduct.

[1.20] [1.21]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.1): The recipient of the vow [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.1]
The basis for taking this vow is the holding of one of the seven kinds of prātimokṣa vow, from the upāsaka vows up to the vows of a bhikṣu, as well as abandoning inherent misdeeds in general.10 This is done always—i.e. for as long as one lives. Apart from holding this basis, the good fortune or viable conditions of this bodhisattva vow will not be found anywhere and will not obtain, because the bodhisattva vow is for those who are able to bring benefit to others directly or indirectly, which is incompatible with the harming of others.

[1.22]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.2): The bestower of the vow [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.2]
There are four qualities which one should know the excellent lama to have:

[1.23]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.1): The ritual when the lama is present [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.1]
The ritual of the bodhisattva vow is taught in the chapter on moral discipline found in the Bodhisattvabhūmi composed by the noble Asaṅga. The excellent lama is someone who completely possesses the requisite characteristics. One should take the vow of application bodhicitta from such a lama by completing its preliminary, main and concluding stages, as follows.

[1.24] [1.25]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.1): General and specific commitments to explain this in accord with the tradition [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.1]
Although one may have tried very hard to meet a lama who is qualified with such requisite characteristics to bestow the vow in the manner explained above, one may nevertheless have been completely unable to find such a one due to certain conditions of place and time. What then is to be done? There is, for this specific circumstance, another ritual, besides the ritual for the lama being present, in which one may take the vow by oneself. This ritual for taking the vow when the lama is absent I shall here properly explain in accord with the teachings of the tradition. This constitutes the general commitment to explain the ritual.

[1.26]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.1): Generating bodhicitta [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.1]
The Protectors of all sentient beings are the enlightened Buddhas, in the presence of whom I generate the completely perfect, unsurpassed bodhicitta. For this purpose, all beings without exception, reaching to the ends of space, I invite as my guests, i.e. I will bring benefit to them, liberating them from the saṃsāric rivers of suffering, which they have not crossed over, and unlocking the chains of the origination of suffering, from which they have not been freed. With the truth of the path, I will expel the breath of the view of self for those who have not expelled it, and with the truth of cessation I will place in nirvāṇa, the transcendence of torment, those who have not transcended the torment of dualistic grasping. Therefore this way of presenting the invitation of guests in terms of the Four Noble Truths is explained by Sharawa as a practice of both aspiration and application.

[1.27] [1.28]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.1): Adopting the moral conduct of avoiding violations of the vow [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.1]
From now, this day, for as long as I have not yet attained unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, I promise to cease the following four intentions. Intentions of harm, such as wanting to kill out of hatred, arise in dependence upon the various causes of malicious thought. Aggression is sudden outbursts of anger towards others. Greed is an inability to give things away to others. Envy is dissatisfaction with the prosperity of others.

[1.29]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.2): Adopting the moral conduct of benefitting sentient beings [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.2]
Taking no pleasure and feeling no joy in the intention swiftly to attain enlightenment for myself, I will remain for as long as saṃsāra has not reached its final end for the benefit of even a single being.

[1.30] [1.31]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.3): Adopting the moral conduct of gathering virtuous dharmas [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.2.2.2.3]
One may ask what is to be practised after the foregoing has been stabilised. One should utterly purify inconceivable Buddha fields of imperfections such as ravines, briars and so forth, without any graspable limit. With the wish to bring benefit to those beings who hear one’s name and remember it, or who see, hear, remember or touch one, by means of one’s fame throughout the realms of all the ten directions, and by remaining there for them, one will purify and ripen the worlds of sentient beings.

[1.32]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.1.1): The actual training [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.1.1]
What is the cause of the purification of the three gates? The subject of purification is the bodhisattva, the one who belongs to the Mahāyāna family and who keeps the vow of application bodhicitta. The purpose of so doing is to cause the complete purification of downfalls from their own body, speech and mind and to train in the causes of the supreme benefit of other sentient beings. The object is the moral conduct of the three trainings. If one trains with diligence and in the proper manner, by the power of one’s practice, one’s devotion, by which one holds with great reverence the moral conduct of the three previously mentioned trainings, will grow greater.

[1.33]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.1.2): Its great importance [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.1.2]
One’s body, speech and mind will be purified by training in the three kinds of moral conduct. Therefore, the complete purification of what is to be abandoned and the absolute perfection of the antidotes results in unsurpassed enlightenment. The bodhisattvas who are intent upon or focussed upon achieving this for the benefit of others will keep pure or maintain the vows of the three kinds of moral conduct, among which the moral conduct of the vow is the most important. By means of mindfulness, clear comprehension and concern, they will endeavour diligently and with great dedication in the causes of perfect enlightenment—the two accumulations of merit and wisdom—and will completely fulfill these.

[1.34] [1.35] [1.36] [1.37] [1.38]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.1): That training in calm abiding is the cause of developing the higher knowledges [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.1]
Therefore, the specific cause of completely perfecting and bringing to fulfilment the two accumulations, the natures of which are merit and wisdom, is held by all the Buddhas of the three times to be the development of the six higher knowledges.

[1.39] [1.40ab]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.1): The prerequisites of calm abiding [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.1]
Can calm abiding be achieved through diligence alone? No. While the conditions or causal prerequisites of calm abiding are weak, even to meditate with strong diligence and fierce exertion for as long a time as many thousands of years will not accomplish the samādhi of calm abiding. Therefore, because calm abiding will not be achieved if these conditions are weak, one should maintain well the conditions taught in the Tract on the Accumulation of Samādhi,15 the Śrāvakabhūmi and so forth. By achieving this, samādhi will develop.

[1.40cd]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.2): How to meditate on calm abiding [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.2]
Place the mind in virtue on any suitable object of attention.

[1.41ab]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.3): The benefits of the meditation [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.2.2.3]
When the yogin makes effort like the continual flow of a river in the aforementioned samādhi and attains calm abiding, not only are the higher knowledges attained through such training, but also the non-conceptual primordial wisdoms. The Noble Lord himself said in the Summary of the Accomplishment of the Mahāyāna Path,

[1.41cd] [1.42]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.1): The essential point of the need to train in the wisdom of higher insight [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.1]
One may yet wonder in that case whether it is sufficient merely to develop calm abiding and the higher knowledges which come from that. Although one may abandon the manifest defilements through ordinary meditative concentrations, since these are without the yoga or union of the perfection of wisdom that cognises reality itself, one will not exhaust the seeds of either of the two obscurations of defilements and cognition. Mahācārya Candragomin said in the Praise of Confession,

[1.43]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.2): The essential point of the need to train in unifying means and wisdom [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.2]
Since neither wisdom alone without skilful means nor skilful means alone without wisdom will bring about Buddhahood, those who seek perfect enlightenment must train in the path of unifying means and wisdom. The Bhagavān Buddha said in the Sūtra of the Teaching of Vimalakīrti,

[1.44]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.1): Brief summary [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.1]
One may then ask what is the specific nature of each of these? In order to eliminate such doubts, misunderstandings and false ideas concerning what ‘wisdom’ and ‘skilful means’ are, I will now clarify the correct and inerrant distinction or differentiation between the essential characteristics of skilful means and wisdom, which may otherwise seem indistinct.

[1.45]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.1): Identifying means [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.1]
Apart from or excluding the perfection of wisdom, all of the virtuous white dharmas which accomplish bodhicitta, such as for instance the perfection of giving, were taught by the Conquerors of the three times to belong to the category of skilful means.

[1.46]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.2): The necessity of developing it [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.2]
Having begun to meditate upon impermanence, actions and results, whoever, a bodhisattva, cultivates the wisdom which severs the mental habit of objective grasping at the characteristics of whatever is conceived as outer or inner objects, has a very great ability to abandon the obscurations through the power of practising very stably the cultivation of skilful means, such as giving. They will soon attain unsurpassed enlightenment itself but, should they neglect the aspect of means by cultivating non-self alone, they will not attain unsurpassed enlightenment.

[1.47]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.3): Identifying wisdom [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.1.3.2.3]
The five skandhas, eighteen dhātus, and twelve āyatanās are the thirty-five ‘dharmins’ or objects [Tib. dmigs pa]. The perceptible qualities which are above these are ‘dharmas’ or qualities [Tib. rnam pa]. All of these are to be understood or recognised as being without arising with an intrinsic nature. The primary cause of wandering in saṃsāra is attachment to the reality of the substantial existence of whatever appears. Moreover, to grasp at arising with an intrinsic nature is itself the basis of all the other grasping at substantial existence. Thus it is necessary to cease that by understanding that there is no arising with an intrinsic nature. Similarly, there is no departing either, as if what formerly arose is subsequently destroyed. Since they have always been empty, this recognition of the emptiness of the intrinsic nature of all dharmas, which are to be understood as without arising with an intrinsic nature, is the definition of ‘wisdom’ from among the two terms ‘means’ and ‘wisdom’. This recognition also constitutes the essential training of wisdom.

[1.48]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.1): The analysis of result: the argument of arising and cessation from existence or nonexistence [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.1]
In response to the foregoing definition of wisdom as the recognition of nonarising with intrinsic nature, proponents of substantial existence might say, ‘We do not accept this. Objects arise with an intrinsic nature and pass away because they are actually existent.’

[1.49]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.2): The analysis of cause: the argument of the vajra slivers [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.2]
Outer and inner objects are the logical subject. They do not arise from self, because their arising would have no purpose and would recur infinitely. Furthermore, as Nāgārjuna says in Root Verses on the Middle Way,

[1.50]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.3): The analysis of nature: the argument of the one and the many [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.3]
Or, in addition to the preceding explanations, another argument may be presented. All outer and inner dharmas are the logical subject. If they are analysed for the existence of an inherent intrinsic nature as a singularity and as a multiplicity, no objectively existent essence is seen, not even so much as an atom. Since that is the case, it is certain they have no intrinsic nature, being like, for example, reflections in a mirror.

[1.51] [1.52]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.2): Showing the wisdom of hearing which arises in dependence upon scripture [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.1.2]
In order that intelligent ones may be correctly led towards certainty in profound emptiness, they should study the following texts to resolve all doubts. To establish the definitive meaning of emptiness by scriptural tradition, one should study Nāgārjuna’s Sūtrasamuccaya. To establish by reasoning the arguments for emptiness, one should study the logic of Nāgārjuna’s collection of reasonings such as the Seventy Verses on Emptiness and the Root Verses on the Middle Way, which definitively establish profound emptiness through many arguments. ‘And so forth’ means one should also study the supreme works of Buddhapālita and the most venerable Candrakīrti, which explain the true intent of the Noble Lord Nāgārjuna, and the works of Śāntideva too. These texts show the proofs for the emptiness of the intrinsic nature of things, the primordial nature of reality. One should be read thoroughly and their meaning should be decisively understood.

[1.53] [1.54]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.2): How to meditate on higher insight [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.2]
Therefore having determined that all dharmas, which are composites of skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanās, are without self, if individuals or any dharma without any exception whatsoever, such as the skandhas, had an intrinsic nature, then one would have discovered it when one searched for it with scripture and reasoning. Yet since one does not see as much as an atom with an intrinsic nature, there is no self which exists with an intrinsic nature in individuals or dharmas. Whoever meditates on this and applies such reasoning is meditating upon the perfection of wisdom. As it says in the Bhāvanākrama of Kamalaśīla,

[1.55]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.3.1): The main part [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.3.1]
The entirety of the foundations of the three realms of this saṃsāric world comes from the conceptual discrimination of clinging to reality. Its very core is contrived by conceptual discrimination. Therefore, abandon conceptual discrimination entirely and without remainder, along with all of its imprints. That attainment establishes all benefits of self and other in the supreme liberation of non-abiding nirvāṇa.

[1.56] [1.57]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.3.2): Establishing it by scriptural reference [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.3.2]
Thus one might ask how saṃsāra arises from conceptual discrimination and how it can be abandoned by meditation on non-self. The Bhagavān said in the Saṃpūṭa tantra that conceptual discrimination, the grasping of objects, is to be known as the great ignorance that is the foundation of conditioned existence, because its force plunges one into the bottomless and shoreless ocean of saṃsāra. When one attains the certainty of the analytical understanding of non-self as the antidote to conceptual discrimination which grasps reality, one rests in and cultivates the non-discriminating samādhi that is free from the conceptual discrimination of analytical categories. When this meditation is perfected, one will clearly see revealed the true non-discriminating nature of mind which, like the sky, is free from the obscuring clouds of autumn. As it says in the Saṃpūṭa tantra,

Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.2): Concluding summary of how to train in higher insight [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.1.2.2.3.3.2.2]
With the scriptures of definitive meaning and the flawless collections of reasoning, having made certain and cut any doubts that individuals and all dharmas such as the skandhas are in reality nonarising, or without arising with an intrinsic nature, meditate one-pointedly without the discrimination of grasping at characteristics in the natures of things. As it is said in Āryaśūra’s Jātakamāla,

[1.59]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.1.2): Analytical presentation of the result [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.1.2]
Thus on the basis of the common refuges, one trains one’s mind on the paths of the lesser and intermediate persons, and then develops both aspiration and application bodhicitta. Together with the practices of vast skilful means, one meditates upon suchness with calm abiding and higher insight. If one does this, one will fully travel the lesser, intermediate and great stages of the path of accumulation, and then attain the successive stages of heat etc., i.e. the four stages concordant to realisation comprising the path of application. Then one achieves the first bhūmi, called ‘Joyful’, the second bhūmi, called ‘Immaculate’, etc. until one attains the resultant conditions of the vajra-like samādhi at the tenth bhūmi. Then the result of the final completion of the path—the level of the great enlightenment of a Buddha, endowed with the three kāyas and five primordial wisdoms— will not be far off and will soon be attained. Activities of ripening and liberating limitless beings of good fortune will arise spontaneously and uninterruptedly for as long as saṃsāra exists. As it says in Maitreya’s Abhisamayālaṃkāra,

Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.2.1.1): The individual who is the basis [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.2.1.1]
While one may come perfectly to fulfil the benefits of self and other by practising the six perfections and four gatherings in the tradition of the vehicle of the perfections, if one travels the path of the Vajrayāna with the four enlightened activities, such as pacifying and increasing, and also with powers such as the eight great attainments, like the excellent vase attainment which grants all of one’s wishes,21 then accomplishment will come through the power of mantra.

[1.62] [1.63]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.2.1.2): The empowerment which ripens them [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.2.1.2]
Then, once one has the basis of the Vajrayāna path, wishing to enter the secret mantra, one should please the holy lama who possesses the necessary qualities. Why should one do this? For the sake of receiving the vajrācārya empowerment, as well as the three higher empowerments.22 How should one do this? One should please the holy lama who bestows the empowerment with all one has of body, speech and mind, such as with physical and verbal veneration, with gifts of whatever goods he or she may wish for, such as jewels, garments, food and drink, and service, and by accomplishing his instructions perfectly and with dedication. As it says in Maitreya’s Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra,

[1.64] [1.65] [1.66]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.2.2): Specific qualifications for those who would receive the two higher empowerments [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.2.2]
Can anyone who wishes to attain siddhis receive these empowerments? Because the Bhagavān, in the great root tantra of the Paramādibuddha Kālacakra, made it expressly forbidden, laymen observing pure conduct and those monastics holding the discipline of the five kinds of monastic vows should not receive from others the secret and wisdom empowerments, nor bestow the empowerments themselves.

[1.67]
Section (2.3.2.2.3.2.2.3): Analysing whether it is appropriate to teach, hear etc. the tantras if the two higher empowerments have not been received [LPE-2.3.2.2.3.2.2.3]
If it is inappropriate for those who practise pure conduct to receive the two higher empowerments, are they also unable to practise the conduct of the secret mantras? There is no fault for them to do so. For disciples to hear all of the four classes of tantra, such as Kriyā etc., and for teachers to explain them; for both to perform fire pūjās, make offerings, perform consecrations and so forth, are not faults for those who have received or obtained the ācārya empowerment and know the ten thusnesses.23

Section (2.3.3): The reason for composing the text [LPE-2.3.3]
The divinely descended bhikṣu, Changchub-O, who propagated the Buddha’s teachings in Tibet, supplicated thus: “You must certainly bestow upon us a text on the meaning of the whole of the Buddha’s teaching which will be a chariot for Mahāyāna practitioners.” Upon which, the Mahāsthavira, one who is a crown jewel of all of the eighteen Hīnayāna subsects, having received full ordination and held a perfectly unbroken continuity of vows for over thirty years, Dīpaṃkaraśrī, gave a complete explanation of the Mahāyāna path from the level of a beginner up to complete enlightenment in accord with what he had seen explained in precious teachings such as the sūtras, certain tantras, and explanatory śāstras. As he said in his Song of Developing A Resolute Mind Concerning Saṃsāra,
