b) Because mantras are too weak and lack sufficient power to generate the necessary conditions for producing minds
c) Because mantras are not real things and therefore cannot produce any effects whatsoever on sentient beings
d) Because minds cannot be illusory in nature, since consciousness is always genuinely existent and not conditioned
ANSWER: a
VERSE REF(S): 9.12
