Chapter 1: In Praise of Bodhicitta

To the Sugatas, the dharmakāya they have mastered, and their sons,
And to all those worthy of prostration, I respectfully prostrate.
In accord with the tradition, I will now briefly explain 
How to enter the vow of the Sugatas’ sons.
[1.1]

Nothing said here has not been said before,
And I have neither eloquence nor erudition,
So, I do not expect this to benefit others.
I composed it only to develop my own understanding. [1.2]

Because of developing virtue like this,
The power of my faith will increase for a little while.
But if others, similar in fortune to me,
Should see it, that is also of benefit. [1.3]

It is extremely difficult to acquire the freedoms and endowments
Which make this human birth meaningful.
If I fail to benefit from it now,
How will I get a chance like this again? [1.4]

Just as lightning flashes for an instant
Through the dark, black clouds of the night,
Likewise, only rarely, merit and intelligence arise
Fleetingly in the world through the power of the Buddhas. [1.5]

In this way, virtue is constantly weak and feeble,
And the extremely great power of nonvirtue overwhelms.
What virtue, if not perfect bodhicitta,
Could possibly overcome it? [1.6]

The mighty sages, who have known it for many aeons,
Have seen that only bodhicitta has this power.
With bodhicitta, limitless multitudes
Will easily attain the supreme bliss. [1.7]

Those wishing to end the many sufferings of conditioned existence,
Those wishing to dispel the unhappiness of beings,
And those wishing for many happinesses,
Should never abandon this bodhicitta. [1.8]

The very instant bodhicitta arises
In someone tormented in the prison of saṃsāra,
They will be called an ‘heir of the Sugatas’,
And be praised by gods and men. [1.9]

Like a supreme alchemical elixir,
Having imbibed it, the impure body is transformed
Into the priceless jewel of the kāya of a conqueror.
So, firmly take hold of what is called ‘bodhicitta’. [1.10]

If the only guides of beings have, with unfettered minds,
Seen its value in consummate examination,
Those of us who want to be free from wandering
Should firmly grasp the precious bodhicitta. [1.11]

All other virtues are, like a plantain tree,
Exhausted after they produce their fruit,
But the perennial tree of bodhicitta
Grows with an inexhaustible supply. [1.12]

Like facing great terrors accompanied by a warrior,
Even those who have committed the extremely evil acts
Will instantly be freed by relying on it.
Why then would conscientious people not rely on this? [1.13]

Like the fire at the end of time, great evils
Are totally consumed by it.
Its benefits are limitless,
As Lord Maitreya explained to Sudhana. [1.14]

When summarized, bodhicitta
Should be known as having two types:
Bodhicitta of aspiration
And bodhicitta of application. [1.15]

Like understanding the difference
Between wishing to go and going,
So the wise should understand the difference
Between these two, respectively. [1.16]

For those wandering in saṃsāra,
Great results arise from aspiration bodhicitta,
But a ceaseless stream of merits does not arise
As it does for application bodhicitta. [1.17]

For whoever embraces
This incontrovertible intent to liberate
Limitless realms of beings,
By the perfect adoption of that intent, [1.18]

From the moment of embracing it, even when asleep
Or distracted, a force of merit
As vast as space
Arises in an uninterrupted stream. [1.19]

The Tathāgata himself taught
These benefits along with their reasons
In the Sutra Requested by Subahu
For the sake of those inclined to lesser paths. [1.20]

Even if one wishes to dispel merely
The head pains of beings,
The possession of that beneficial intention
Is endowed with boundless merit. [1.21]

What can one say then of the wish to dispel
The endless unhappiness of each sentient being,
Wishing to establish every single one of them
In limitless qualities? [1.22]

Do even our father or mothers
Ever have such a benevolent wish?
Do even the gods, the rishis,
Or even Brahmā harbour such benevolence? [1.23]

Those beings never before,
Even in their dreams,
Had an intention like this, even for their own sake.
How could it arise then for the sake of others? [1.24]

The intention to benefit others did not arise
For sentient beings even for their own sake.
The arising of this highest treasure of the mind
Is an unprecedented wonder. [1.25]

It is the cause of joy in all wandering beings.
It is the elixir remedying the suffering of sentient beings.
How can the merit of this treasure of mind
Even begin to be measured or quantified? [1.26]

If the mere intention to help others
Is better than making offerings to the Buddhas,
What can one say about the endeavour
To bring happiness and benefit to all beings without exception? [1.27]

Though they long to be free from suffering,
They hurriedly chase after suffering itself.
Though they long for happiness, in their ignorance,
They destroy it as though their own happiness were their enemy. [1.28]

Whoever is destitute of happiness
And burdened with many sufferings
Will be filled with every happiness
And cut off from all their suffering. [1.29]

Their ignorance, too, will be dispelled.
What virtue could equal that?
What friend can compare to it?
What merit is remotely comparable to it? [1.30]

If one who repays a helpful deed
Is worthy of some praise,
What can one say of the bodhisattva
Whose excellent deeds are unsolicited? [1.31]

Worldly people respect someone who briefly
Gives a little food, contemptuously,
To a few beings, satisfying them only for half a day,
Saying, ‘That was a virtuous deed.’ [1.32]

What can one say then of someone who
Always gives the unsurpassed happiness
Of the Sugatas to countless sentient beings throughout time,
The ultimate perfection of their wishes? [1.33]

If one should develop a malevolent intention
Towards such beneficent sons of the conquerors,
The Sage has taught they will remain in the hells
For as many aeons as malevolent thoughts developed. [1.34]

Nevertheless, if one’s attitude is good,
The results will be even greater.
The sons of the conquerors, with great seriousness,
Never perform nonvirtue and their virtues continuously increase. [1.35]

I bow down before
Those in whom this sacred jewel of mind is born,
And I take refuge in those sources of happiness
Who bring happiness even to those who harm them. [1.36]

Chapter 2: Confession of Faults

In order to take hold of this treasure of mind,
I make offerings properly to the oceans of good qualities—
The stainless jewels of the Tathāgata, the holy dharma,
And the sons of the Buddhas. [2.1]

I offer every flower and fruit there is,
Every kind of restorative,
All the wealth in the world,
And all the clear, refreshing waters. [2.2]

Likewise, I offer bejewelled mountains,
Secluded and delightful forest groves,
Trees of paradise rich with blossoming flowers,
Many trees with branches laden with excellent fruit, [2.3]

The beautiful fragrances of gods and men,
All incense, wish granting trees and bejewelled trees,
All kinds of crops, cultivated without effort,
And everything else worthy of offering, all ornamented with [2.4]

Lakes and pools adorned with lotus flowers,
Mellifluous with the song of wild geese,
In the endlessness of space and in innumerable worlds,
All completely unowned. [2.5]

Thinking of these, I offer them properly
To the sages, supreme among men, and their sons.
Holy recipients, out of your compassion,
Please accept my offerings and think of me with kindness. [2.6]

I am without merit and completely destitute;
I have no other wealth to give.
Therefore, protectors, you who think only of the benefit of others,
Please accept these for my benefit. [2.7]

To the conquerors and their sons, I offer
All my bodies. Sublime beings,
Please always accept them,
And I will be your devoted servant. [2.8]

When I am under your protection,
I will fearlessly bring benefit to sentient beings in conditioned existence.
I will completely overcome my former nonvirtues 
And henceforth cease all other nonvirtues. [2.9]

In freshly scented bathing houses,
With crystal floors, clear and bright,
And columns shimmering with jewels,
Decorated with canopies alight with pearls, [2.10]

To the Tathāgatas and their sons
With many precious vases, filled with
Scented water that delights the senses, and with many songs
And music, I request to bathe the Buddhas’ forms. [2.11]

I then wipe dry their bodies with the finest cloths,
Fresh and fragranced with scents.
To the holy ones I offer
Fragrant robes of appropriate colours. [2.12]

With all kinds of excellent garments, soft and fine,
And an array of supreme ornaments, I adorn
Ārya Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa,
Avalokiteśvara and the others. [2.13]

With supreme scents that permeate
The three thousand-fold world system, I anoint
The bodies of the lords of sages, blazing with light,
Like polishing pure, burnished gold. [2.14]

To the supreme objects of worship, the lords of sages, I offer
Delightful flowers such as mandaras, lotuses
And utpalas, all sweet-smelling and
Wonderfully laid out in garlands, [2.15]

And I offer clouds of permeating incense, enchanting to the mind,
From the finest incense sticks,
And I offer many kinds of
Ambrosial foods and drinks. [2.16]

I offer jewelled lamps, arranged upon
Rows of golden lotus flowers.
Their grounds fragrant with the perfume
Of flower petals scattered upon it, [2.17]

I offer vast palaces, resonant with pleasing songs of praise,
Bright and resplendent with hanging ornaments of pearls and jewels,
Ornamenting the vastnesses of space,
To those who have the nature of compassion. [2.18]

I offer to the lords of sages
Beautiful jewelled parasols with golden handles,
Decorated with handsome designs and
Held aloft in arrangements joyful to behold, [2.19]

And a multitude of other offerings,
With music delightful to hear.
I present billowing clouds of offerings
To soothe the sufferings of sentient beings. [2.20]

May an uninterrupted rain
Of flowers and precious gems descend
Upon all the jewels of holy dharma,
The stupas and statues. [2.21]

Just as Mañjughoṣa and others
Made offerings to the conquerors,
Likewise I make offerings
To the Tathāgatas and their sons. [2.22]

I praise these oceans of good qualities
With oceans of melodious praise.
May these pleasing clouds of melodious praise
Always ascend to their ears. [2.23]

To the Buddhas of the three times,
To the dharma, and to the supreme among communities,
With bodies as numerous as atoms
I respectfully prostrate. [2.24]

I prostrate to the bases of bodhicitta,
And to the stupas,
And I prostrate to preceptors, ācāryas,
And the supreme practitioners. [2.25]

Until the essence of enlightenment,
I take refuge in the Buddha,
And likewise in the dharma
And the assembly of bodhisattvas. [2.26]

To the perfect Buddhas and bodhisattvas
Who dwell in all directions,
And who possess great compassion,
I supplicate you with joined palms. [2.27]

Having wandered without beginning
In this life and in others,
I stupidly performed nonvirtues,
Or commanded them to be done. [2.28]

Compelled by ignorance and delusion,
I took pleasure in this.
Now seeing this was a terrible mistake,
I sincerely confess it to the protectors. [2.29]

Whatever harm I have done towards
The Three Jewels, my parents, my teachers and others,
Based on the defilements,
And whatever nonvirtues I, burdened with nonvirtue [2.30]

And afflicted with many faults, have done
With my body, speech or mind,
These deeds, now utterly unbearable to me,
I confess before the guides of the world. [2.31]

I will die before
My nonvirtues have been purified.
So that I may be saved from them,
I pray for your protection to come swiftly. [2.32]

The untrustworthy Lord of Death
Will not wait for me to be ready.
Regardless of whether I am sick or healthy,
This fleeting life is unstable. [2.33]

Everything must be left behind and I must go, too.
Yet, without understanding this,
Because of friends and foes,
I have carried out all kinds of nonvirtue. [2.34]

My foes will become nothing.
My friends will become nothing.
I, too, will become nothing.
In this way, all of us will become nothing. [2.35]

Like experiences in dreams,
We get involved with this and that,
But these will become only memories,
For whatever has passed will never be seen again. [2.36]

In the short time of this life,
Many friends and foes have already passed,
But whatever unbearable nonvirtues
I carried out because of them still await me. [2.37]

Not even understanding
That I, too, am just as temporary as they were,
Out of ignorance, desire and hatred,
I have done many nonvirtues. [2.38]

If, without respite, day and night,
This life is running out,
And there is no granting of an extension,
Why would death not come for someone like me? [2.39]

Lying on my death bed,
Though surrounded by all my friends and family,
The sensations of life ending
Will be experienced by me alone. [2.40]

When seized by the messengers of the Lord of Death,
What good is family, what good are friends?
Merit alone will protect me then,
But I have never really relied on it. [2.41]

Oh protectors—I was unconcerned and,
Not realizing this would be so terrifying,
I carried out many nonvirtues
For the sake of this impermanent life. [2.42]

Even now, when someone is told
They are to be taken to a torture chamber, they are terrified.
Their appearance quickly changes:
Their mouth becomes dry, their eyes bulge and so on. [2.43]

What need to mention the utter despair
Of being in the grasp of the terrifying
Messengers of the Lord of Death,
And being sick with terror. [2.44]

‘Can anyone protect me
From such a great horror?’
With gaping eyes and a terrified aspect,
I will search in the four directions for a refuge, [2.45]

But not seeing any refuge in the four directions,
I will be enveloped in despair.
Then, when I have no refuge,
What am I going to do? [2.46]

Therefore, to the conquerors, the protectors,
Who strive in their purpose of protecting beings,
And whose great power dispels all fears,
I go for refuge from this day forth. [2.47]

In the dharma taken to heart,
Which dispels fear of saṃsāra,
And in the assembly of bodhisattvas,
I likewise completely take refuge. [2.48]

Overwhelmed by fear,
I offer myself to Samantabhadra.
To Mañjughoṣa
I make an offering of my own body. [2.49]

To the protector Avalokiteśvara
Who unerringly acts out of compassion,
I call out with a desperate cry,
Begging him to protect me, someone so burdened with nonvirtue. [2.50]

To Ārya Ākāśagarbha
And to Kṣitigarbha, too,
And to all the lords of great compassion,
Seeking refuge, I cry out for their help. [2.51]

To Vajrapāṇi, the sight of whom
Makes malevolent beings, like the messengers
Of the Lord of Death, scatter to the four directions,
I go for refuge. [2.52]

In the past, I defied your advice but,
Now, seeing such great horrors,
I pray that they will be dispelled
By my truly going for refuge to you. [2.53]

If I need to follow the doctor’s advice
Out of fear of just a common illness,
What can be said of being constantly sick
With the hundred faults of desire and so forth. [2.54]

If any one of these
Can destroy everyone in the world,
And if no other cure for them
Is anywhere to be found, [2.55]

Then the attitude of disregarding
The instructions of the omniscient physician,
Which remediate all these maladies,
Is extremely stupid and contemptible. [2.56]

If I need to be careful
Near an ordinary, shallow ridge,
What can be said of this abyss
Which plummets for a thousand miles? [2.57]

‘Surely I won’t die today!’
It is hardly appropriate to be so casual,
When the time of my end
Will inevitably come. [2.58]

What can take away this horror?
What can I do to be free from it?
If the end is inevitable,
How can I be relaxed and content? [2.59]

The past was experienced and now it is gone.
What is left of that for me now?
Through my attachment to it,
I defied the instructions of the teacher. [2.60]

If I must leave behind this life
And all its friends and acquaintances,
Going on alone to who knows where,
How can these friends and enemies matter? [2.61]

‘Suffering comes from nonvirtue.
How can I be definitively freed from that?’
Day and night, I should constantly consider
Nothing but this very thought. [2.62]

Insensibly and ignorantly,
Whatever nonvirtues, whether inherent
Or attendant, that I have done, [2.63]

In the presence of the protectors,
With palms joined and desperately aware of the suffering,
Again and again I prostrate
And confess all of these acts. [2.64]

Guides of the world, please look upon
My mistakes and nonvirtues.
They lack any goodness at all.
From now on, I will not do them anymore. [2.65]

Chapter 3: Fully Holding Bodhicitta

In the virtue which alleviates the sufferings
Of all beings in the lower realms,
And places those who are suffering in happiness,
I gladly rejoice. [3.1]

In the gathering of virtue
Which causes enlightenment, I rejoice.
In the complete liberation
From the suffering of saṃsāric birth, I rejoice. [3.2]

In the enlightenment of the protectors
And their sons’ attainment of the bhūmis, I rejoice. [3.3]

In the ocean of virtue in generating the resolution
To bring happiness to all sentient beings,
And in the virtuous deeds for the benefit
Of sentient beings, I rejoice. [3.4]

Folding my hands, I implore
The Buddhas in all directions:
Please shine the light of dharma
For sentient beings suffering in darkness. [3.5]

Folding my hands, I implore
The conquerors who wish to pass beyond torment:
Please do not leave these creatures to their blindness
But stay here for countless aeons. [3.6]

Having done all this,
Whatever I may have gathered by this virtue,
May it eliminate all the sufferings
Of all sentient beings. [3.7]

Whatever sicknesses beings may have,
Until they are all cured,
May I be their medicine, their doctor,
And may I nurse them back to health. [3.8]

May deluges of food and drink
Eliminate the sufferings of hunger and thirst
And, during ages of famine,
May I become food and drink. [3.9]

May I become an inexhaustible supply of riches
For beings in deprivation and poverty,
And may I be right there in their presence,
As all kinds of provisions and necessities. [3.10]

In order to bring benefit to all beings,
I will, without any hesitation, give up
My body, its pleasures,
And all my merits of the past, present and future. [3.11]

Nirvāṇa is attained by giving everything up.
Nirvāṇa is my goal,
And to give everything at once
To sentient beings is the supreme giving. [3.12]

Since I have now given my body to embodied beings
For whatever end may make them happy,
Let them do with it whatever they like—
Even killing, insulting or beating it. [3.13]

Though they may treat my body as worthless,
Or make it a source of ridicule or mockery,
Since I have now given it to them,
What is the point of cherishing it? [3.14]

I will put up with anything they might do to it,
As long as it will not cause them harm.
Whenever someone sees me,
May it not be without benefit. [3.15]

Having seen me, regardless of whether they develop
An angry or a respectful attitude,
May that always become a cause
Of fulfilling the benefit of all. [3.16]

Whoever may disparage me,
Or harm me in other ways,
However they may insult me,
May they all come to have the good fortune of enlightenment. [3.17]

May I be a protector for the unprotected,
A guide for travellers on the road
And, for those who want to cross the water,
May I be a boat, a ship or a bridge. [3.18]

May I be land for those who seek dry land,
A light for those who lack light,
A lodging for those who want lodging
And, for those who want a servant,
May I be the servant of them all. [3.19]

May I be the wishing jewel, the wondrous vase,
The vidya-mantra, the great medicine,
The inconceivable tree of wishes,
And the cow of plenty, fulfilling the hopes of beings. [3.20]

Like the great elements—earth and so forth—
And, like space itself, remaining without end,
May I be the ground which supports
The countless lives of sentient beings. [3.21]

Similarly, in all places where sentient beings
Dwell throughout the limits of space,
May I be a cause of sustaining life
Until they have all passed beyond suffering. [3.22]

Just as the Sugatas of the past
Generated bodhicitta,
And gradually practised
The bodhisattva trainings, [3.23]

Likewise for the benefit of beings,
I now generate bodhicitta,
And likewise I, too,
Will gradually practise the trainings. [3.24]

Accordingly, those who with intelligence
Have lucidly taken hold of bodhicitta,
In order to increase it,
Should praise the mind with these words: [3.25]

Now, my life is fruitful.
I have properly attained human existence.
Today, born into the family of the Buddhas,
I have become a Buddha’s child. [3.26]

Whatever I undertake to do, my actions
Will be consistent with this lineage.
Nothing I do will corrupt
This faultless, noble lineage. [3.27]

Like a blind man finding
A gem in a pile of rubbish,
Somehow this bodhicitta
Has arisen in me. [3.28]

This is the supreme elixir of life,
Vanquishing death’s sovereignty over the world.
It is an inexhaustible treasure,
Dispelling beings’ sufferings. [3.29]

It is the supreme remedy,
Relieving the sicknesses of beings.
It is a tree to rest under for all beings
Who are wandering and exhausted on saṃsāric paths. [3.30]

It is an open bridge, leading them
Over bad rebirths to freedom.
It is the shining moon of mind
Which dispels the misery of beings’ defilements. [3.31]

It is the great sun which brings an end
To the gloom of beings’ ignorance.
It is the fresh butter extracted
From churning the milk of the holy dharma. [3.32]

Beings wandering abroad on the paths of conditioned existence,
Wishing to have happiness,
Will encounter this supreme happiness,
And those great wanderers will at last be contented. [3.33]

Today, in the presence of all the protectors,
Until they have attained buddhahood itself,
I invite beings to every happiness.
May the gods, demigods and all the rest be joyful. [3.34]

Chapter 4: Concern

Having firmly grasped bodhicitta
In this way, a conqueror’s son
Should never neglect it,
But instead strive never to violate the training. [4.1]

Whatever I have undertaken rashly
Or not properly thought through,
Even if I have promised to do it,
I should reconsider, asking myself, ‘Should I stop?’ [4.2]

The Buddhas and their sons
Examine things with their great wisdom,
And even I can examine them,
So why would I hesitate in doing so? [4.3]

Having made this commitment,
If I do not act to fulfil it,
Then, since I will have deceived all sentient beings,
What kind of rebirth will I take? [4.4]

If it is taught that someone who intended to give
Some meagre, unremarkable thing,
But then did not do so,
Will be reborn as a hungry ghost, [4.5]

Then, having sincerely intended to bring them
To unsurpassed bliss,
If I then deceive all sentient beings,
To what sort of happy rebirth shall I proceed? [4.6]

To give up bodhicitta
But still be liberated;
Such a thing is inconceivable.
Only the Omniscient One could comprehend it. [4.7]

This is the most serious of downfalls
For a bodhisattva,
For, if should it occur,
The benefit of all beings is discarded. [4.8]

Should someone even for a moment
Interrupt or prevent this merit,
Since the benefit of beings is diminished,
Nothing can stop him going to the lower realms. [4.9]

If destroying the happiness of even one sentient being
Will harm me,
What need to mention destroying
The happiness of all beings, as vast as space? [4.10]

Thus, when vacillating in saṃsāra,
Sometimes with the power of downfalls,
Sometimes with the power of bodhicitta,
The attainment of the bhūmis will be obstructed for a long time. [4.11]

Therefore, with dedication I should fulfil
The promise I have made.
If I do not persevere from now on,
I will descend to lower and lower rebirths. [4.12]

Although there have been innumerable Buddhas
Who worked for the benefit of all beings,
My own faults excluded me
From their restorative reach. [4.13]

Moreover, if I continue in this way,
Again and again it will end the same way:
Diseased and fettered in the lower realms,
Shattered and cut apart. [4.14]

The arising of a Tathāgata,
Faith, obtaining a human birth
And the conditions for cultivating virtue
Are very rare. When will they be attained again? [4.15]

Today, at least, I am not sick.
I have food to eat and am not afflicted.
But this life is fleeting and deceptive,
And this body is on loan only for a little while. [4.16]

My conduct being the way it is,
I will not attain a human body again
And, if I do not attain a human body,
There will be only nonvirtue and no virtue. [4.17]

Even when I do have the chance to practise virtue,
If I fail to do so,
What will I do when I am
Completely obscured by the sufferings of the lower realms? [4.18]

Not practising any virtues,
But gathering many nonvirtues,
For hundreds of millions of aeons
I will not even hear the words ‘happy rebirth’. [4.19]

It is because of this the Bhagavān said
That the difficulty of attaining a human birth
Is like a turtle putting its neck through
A wooden yoke adrift on a great ocean. [4.20]

If just a moment of nonvirtue
Can lead to an aeon in the Avīci Hell,
What need to mention my not proceeding to a happy rebirth,
With nonvirtues collected since beginningless time in saṃsāra? [4.21]

Even after having suffered such experiences,
I still won’t be free of them,
For, even while undergoing them,
I will commit yet more nonvirtue. [4.22]

Having acquired this kind of freedom,
If I do not cultivate virtue,
There could be no greater deception,
And no greater delusion. [4.23]

So, having understood this,
If later in confusion I stop trying,
Then the hour of my approaching death
Will stir up extreme distress. [4.24]

When my body is burning
For a long time in the torturous fires of hell,
Without doubt, my mind will be further tormented
By the unbearable fire of remorse. [4.25]

Having somehow attained this beneficial state,
Extremely difficult to find,
While I have this understanding,
If still I am led back to the hells, [4.26]

Like someone manipulated by mantras,
I must have lost my mind.
I don’t even know who is manipulating me.
Who is this inside of me? [4.27]

Enemies such as hatred and craving,
Don’t have hands or feet,
Aren’t courageous or intelligent,
And yet I act like their slave. [4.28]

While they remain in my mind
They can harm me whenever they want
And I patiently accept it without any resentment,
But this is not a situation that warrants patience. [4.29]

Even if all the gods and demigods
Stood against me as enemies,
They could not lead me into the fires
Of the Avīci Hell, or send me there. [4.30]

But these enemies, the mighty defilements,
Can put me there in an instant,
Where Mount Meru and even its very ashes
Are consumed on contact. [4.31]

What enemy is so interminable,
Without beginning or end, as my own defilements?
No other enemy
Endures as long as they do. [4.32]

When treated well and respected,
Enemies are cooperative and content
But, when the defilements are respected,
They return only pain and suffering. [4.33]

Accordingly, these being my old, implacable enemies,
The sole cause of vastly increasing all kinds of harm,
If I make room for them in my heart,
How can I be unafraid or enjoy saṃsāra? [4.34]

They are the prison guards of saṃsāra who,
In the hells and elsewhere, become my killers and executioners.
So, if they remain in my mind, abiding in the web of attachment,
How can I be happy? [4.35]

Therefore, as long I have not with certainty
Vanquished this enemy, I will never stop persevering.
Growing angry upon some slight, fleeting injury,
The proud and haughty will not sleep until their enemy has been vanquished. [4.36]

On the battlefield, they are eager to vanquish
People with defilements, who would suffer an ordinary death anyway.
Disregarding the pain of being pierced by arrows or swords,
They will not retreat until their objective is won. [4.37]

So, what need to mention that I should not be discouraged or frustrated
To be caused even one hundred thousand sufferings,
When striving to finally vanquish my true, natural enemies,
Who cause all my endless suffering? [4.38]

If scars inflicted by meaningless enemies
Can be shown off on the body like trophies,
What trouble is suffering to me,
When I am striving to achieve a great benefit? [4.39]

If even fishermen, butchers, farmers, etc.
Thinking only of their livelihoods,
Put up with the discomforts of heat and cold,
Why have I no patience for the sake of beings’ happiness? [4.40]

To liberate from the defilements
Beings of the ten directions, as far as the ends of space,
Was my promise but, when I made it,
I was not free from defilements myself. [4.41]

Not understanding my own limitations,
I spoke without knowing how insane this was.
But now I should never turn back from
Vanquishing the defilements. [4.42]

I will be fixated on this,
And full of resentment, wage war
Against the defilements, except those
Which destroy the other defilements. [4.43]

It would be better to be burned alive
Or decapitated
Than to be constantly grovelling
To the enemy defilements. [4.44]

Though ordinary enemies may be driven from our homelands,
They resettle elsewhere,
And return when they have recovered their power,
But the nature of the enemy defilements is not like this. [4.45]

These pathetic defilements, cast out by the eye of wisdom
And extirpated from my mind, where can they go?
Where can they resettle to hurt me again?
And yet, weak-willed, I give up without even trying. [4.46]

The defilements are not within objects, nor within the senses,
Nor in anything else, yet, wherever they are, they harm all beings.
They are like illusions. So, giving up this heartfelt fear, I will cultivate the perseverance to achieve wisdom.
Why should I be tormented in places like the hells for no reason? [4.47]

Having considered this, I will strive
To fulfil the training as it has been explained.
If he doesn’t listen to the doctor’s instructions,
How can the patient be cured by the medicine? [4.48]

Chapter 5: Clear Comprehension

Those who want to guard the training
Must always carefully guard their minds.
If one fails to guard the mind,
It is impossible to guard the training. [5.1]

While the rampaging elephant of mind
Creates the ravages of the Avīci Hell,
An actual wild and untamed elephant
Cannot cause anything like that destruction. [5.2]

When the rope of constant mindfulness
Restrains the elephant of mind,
All troubles subside,
And all virtues fall into my hands. [5.3]

Tigers, lions, elephants, bears,
Snakes, every kind of enemy,
The prison guards of the hells,
Demons and ogres, [5.4]

Will all be restrained
By restraining mind alone,
And will all be subjugated
By subjugating mind alone. [5.5]

In this way, the teacher of perfect truth himself said
That all dangers,
And all the infinite sufferings
Arise from mind. [5.6]

Did anyone deliberately make
The weapons of the hell-beings?
Who made the molten iron ground?
Where did these hosts of women come from? [5.7]

The Sage has taught that all these things
Come from a nonvirtuous mind.
Thus, in the three realms,
There is nothing to fear apart from mind. [5.8]

‘If the perfection of giving
Means dispelling the poverty of beings,
How did the earlier protectors perfect it,
When beings are still poor?’ [5.9]

It is taught that the perfection of giving
Is the intention to give to all beings
All of one’s possessions, along with the results of doing so.
In that sense, it is mind itself. [5.10]

‘Where has the killing of fish 
And other creatures been eradicated?’
The Sage has taught that the intention to abandon this
Is the perfection of moral conduct. [5.11]

Unpleasant beings are as vast as space;
Defeating them would take forever.
But if I overcome this one angry mind,
It would be like defeating all enemies. [5.12]

If I were to cover all the land with leather,
How much leather would it take?
But if I just put leather on my shoes,
It is as if the whole world is covered. [5.13]

Likewise I can never force
All external things to change their course.
But if I could turn around just this mind of mine,
What need would there be to change anything else? [5.14]

While simply cultivating a clear mind
Results in rebirth in realms like that of Brahmā,
Not even a great many acts of body and mind,
Being of lesser modes of conduct, can result in this. [5.15]

All recitations and austerities,
Even if performed extensively,
Are useless, so the Omniscient One has taught,
If practised with a wavering mind. [5.16]

Those who do not understand the secret of mind,
The supreme lord of dharmas,
May wish to have happiness and end their suffering,
But their wishes are futile and they will wander in vain. [5.17]

Therefore, my mind
Should be skilfully held and guarded.
Without the discipline of guarding the mind,
What is the point of many other disciplines? [5.18]

Like being careful to protect a wound
In the midst of a jostling crowd,
So I will constantly guard this wound of a mind
In the midst of bad people. [5.19]

If, frightened of a little pain,
I am careful of a wound,
Why do I not protect the wound of mind
Out of fear of the Crushing Hell? [5.20]

If he can keep to this conduct,
Then whether among bad people
Or a group of women,
The vow-holder’s stability will not be impaired. [5.21]

It is better to have no money, no respect,
And no bodily subsistence,
And better even for every other virtue to degenerate,
Than for the mind for degenerate. [5.22]

To those of you who want to guard your mind,
I implore you, with folded hands:
Protect mindfulness and clear comprehension
With all your might! [5.23]

People disturbed by sickness
Have no strength to do anything.
Similarly, those disturbed by defilements
Also have no strength to do anything. [5.24]

Someone whose mind lacks clear comprehension
May hear, reflect and meditate,
But he will not keep it in his memory.
It will leak like water from a vase. [5.25]

Many who had learning, faith,
And dedicated enthusiasm,
By the fault of losing clear comprehension,
Became embroiled in downfalls. [5.26]

The thieves who want to steal my clear comprehension
Will show up after my loss of mindfulness.
Then, after they have stolen my merit,
I will go to the lower realms. [5.27]

This band of robbers, the defilements,
Are waiting for a good opportunity.
When they find it, they will steal all my virtues
And destroy the life of a good rebirth. [5.28]

Consequently, I should never let mindfulness stray
Past the gateway of mind.
If it ever leaves, remembering the horrors 
Of the lower realms, I must get it back. [5.29]

Through associating with teachers
And attending abbots
With fear, fortunate ones who have respect
Easily develop mindfulness. [5.30]

At all times I am in the presence of
All the Buddhas and bodhisattvas
Whose vision is completely 
Without obstruction. [5.31]

With this in mind, I should have
Shame, respect and fear.
It will also remind me
Again and again of the Buddha. [5.32]

When mindfulness stays,
Guarding the gateway of mind,
Clear comprehension will come.
Then, even if it is lost, it will return. [5.33]

At the outset, having found a mind like this
With some fault,
At that time, like a block of wood,
I should remain undiverted. [5.34]

I should never look all around
Distractedly for no reason,
But rather, with a resolute mind,
Look with eyes lowered. [5.35]

In order to relax my gaze,
I can from time to time look in some direction
And, if someone appears in my field of vision,
I should look up and greet them. [5.36]

In order to identify dangers on the road, etc.
I can repeatedly survey the area.
Pausing and having looked ahead,
I should then look behind. [5.37]

Having checked both ahead and behind,
I can continue on or turn back.
Similarly, in all circumstances,
I should proceed after understanding whatever is appropriate. [5.38]

Having prepared for some activity with the thought, 
‘I will maintain such and such a posture’,
I should occasionally check to see
If I am remaining as intended. [5.39]

Tying the crazed elephant of mind
To the great pillar of contemplating the dharma,
I will always make an effort to check
It has not escaped. [5.40]

Whoever perseveres in this samādhi
Will not lose control even for a moment.
‘Where is this mind of mine going?’
In this way, I will acutely scrutinize my mind. [5.41]

If, due to some danger or celebration,
This is not possible, I can relax.
It is taught in this regard that
At times of giving, moral conduct can be overlooked. [5.42]

Whatever I have intended to do, I should undertake it
And not change my mind about it.
With my mind committed like this,
It will be accomplished in due course. [5.43]

I will carry out everything to completion in this way,
Or nothing else will get done either.
I will not lose clear comprehension
Nor increase the secondary defilements because of this. [5.44]

When I come across
The various kinds of senseless chatter
And the many impressive entertainments,
I should abandon my attachment to them. [5.45]

When I meaninglessly gouge at the earth,
Pick at the grass or draw lines on the ground,
Then, remembering the Tathāgata’s training,
I will concernedly stop right away. [5.46]

When I think of moving or
When I think of speaking,
Having first examined my mind,
I should, with deliberateness, act appropriately. [5.47]

When my mind is desirous or angry
And I want to react, at that time,
I should not react and should not say anything.
Rather, I should remain like a block of wood. [5.48]

When my attitude is irritated or derisive,
Proud, vain, cutting,
Cruel or deceptive, [5.49]

When I am seeking praise
Or criticizing someone,
Insulting them or picking a fight,
At such times, I should remain like a block of wood. [5.50]

When I want to profit, be respected and recognized,
When I want to have subordinates,
Or when I think I should be attended to—
At such times, I should remain like a block of wood. [5.51]

When I want to give up benefitting others
To pursue my own benefit,
Or when I am about to speak out,
Then I should remain like a block of wood. [5.52]

When I am about to be impatient, 
Lazy, afraid, rude, stupid,
Or preferential to my own side,
That is when I should remain like a block of wood. [5.53]

Examining the mind in this way for defilements
And meaningless aims,
The heroic one should hold the mind firmly
With the antidotes. [5.54]

Fully resolved, with proper faith,
Steadfast, respectful, polite,
With care and apprehension, and with calmness, 
I will strive for the happiness of others. [5.55]

Undiscouraged by the inclinations
Of bickering, childish people,
I will think kindly that they are like this
Because of the defilements arising in their minds. [5.56]

Without propagating misdeeds,
Whether acting for myself or sentient beings,
I will always keep this attitude,
Acting selflessly, like an apparition. [5.57]

Thinking again and again
That finally I have attained this supreme freedom,
I will hold on to this mind and it will stray
No more than the king of mountains. [5.58]

Though vultures, wanting flesh,
Will fight to tear it apart,
That does not bother you, mind.
So why cherish it so much now? [5.59]

Having taken this body as ‘mine’,
Why, mind, are you so protective of it?
For if it is really separate from you,
What good is it to you anyway? [5.60]

Why, my defiled mind,
Don’t you instead take a nice, clean block of wood?
Wouldn’t that be better than trying to look after
This contraption, which is a pile of filth, falling apart? [5.61]

First of all, in my mind,
I distinguish the layers of skin.
Then, with the scalpel of discrimination,
I separate the flesh from the skeleton. [5.62]

Having analysed the bones as well,
Until I see their very marrow,
I look and ask myself,
‘Where is the essence in this?’ [5.63]

If, in such a determined search,
I can see no essence,
Why go on protecting
This body with such attachment? [5.64]

If you cannot eat this impure body,
Nor drink its blood,
Nor chew on its offal,
What actual use is it to you? [5.65]

On the other hand, it is alright to look after it
So that the jackals and vultures have something to eat.
These human bodies of ours
Should be used only in service. [5.66]

In this way, even if you do look after it,
When the unsentimental Lord of Death
Seizes it and gives it to the birds and dogs,
What will you do then? [5.67]

If you don’t give clothes, etc.
To servants who will not work for them,
Why do you reward this body,
Which you are going to lose no matter what you feed it? [5.68]

I have already paid the body its wages,
So now it must start working for me.
If it is of no use,
It should not be given anything. [5.69]

On account of its coming and going,
I will think of the body as a boat.
In order to accomplish the benefit of beings,
I will transform it into a wish fulfilling body. [5.70]

While there is the freedom to do this,
Always presenting a cheerful countenance,
I will stop scowling angrily and, instead, 
Be a straightforward friend to the world. [5.71]

I will cease moving my seat around, etc.
In an inconsiderate or noisy way,
And cease slamming doors,
Always enjoying quietness. [5.72]

Cranes, cats and thieves
Move silently and undetected
And evidently get what they want.
The wise should always behave like they do. [5.73]

By accepting respectfully and with gratitude
The unsolicited and beneficial words of others
That admonish or advise me,
I will always be the pupil of everyone. [5.74]

For all that is well-said,
I should call it virtuous.
When I see something meritorious being done,
I will praise it and take delight in it. [5.75]

I should describe good qualities that are hidden,
And I should confirm good qualities that are expressed.
If my own good qualities are mentioned,
I should notice that those good qualities were recognized. [5.76]

Everything we do should be for the sake of joy,
But joy is difficult to buy, even for the wealthy.
So, I will be happy when joy
Is brought about by the good qualities of others. [5.77]

It will cost me nothing now,
And in future lives it will bring great bliss.
Otherwise I will have no joy and only suffering,
And in future lives I will have even greater suffering. [5.78]

When speaking, my speech should be
Authentic, consistent, clear, pleasant,
Without attachment or aversion,
Gentle and appropriate. [5.79]

When my eyes see someone,
Thinking, ‘I can attain buddhahood itself
In dependence upon this very person’,
I will look at them directly and with a gentle regard. [5.80]

Always motivated by aspiration or antidotes,
There will be great virtue
In the fields of good qualities, 
Help and suffering. [5.81]

When I have the knowledge and ability,
I should always do things myself.
In whatever I do, I should not
Be dependent on someone else. [5.82]

The perfections of generosity, etc.
Are each superior to the preceding one.
While I should not give up the greater in favour of the lesser,
The most important thing is to consider the benefit of others. [5.83]

With this in mind, I should always
Keep working to benefit others.
For this, the far-seeing Compassionate One
Permitted what is otherwise forbidden. [5.84]

Apart from consuming just enough food
And wearing the three dharma robes, I will donate the rest
To those who have fallen, those with no protector
And those maintaining discipline. [5.85]

A body being used to practise the holy dharma
Should not be harmed for the sake of something trivial.
If I act in this way, the wishes of beings
Will be fulfilled more quickly. [5.86]

My compassionate intentions being impure,
I should not give away this body,
But in this and future lives,
It may be given to accomplish a great benefit. [5.87]

The dharma should not be explained to the disrespectful:
Those wrapping their heads in cloth like sick men,
Those carrying parasols, sticks, or weapons,
And those covering their heads. [5.88]

The profound and vast should not be taught to the lesser,
Nor to an unaccompanied woman.
I should always show equal respect
To the lesser and supreme teachings. [5.89]

I should not impart the lesser teachings
To a vessel of the vast teachings.
I should not abandon the conduct.
I should not mislead others with sutras or mantras. [5.90]

When cleaning my teeth or spitting,
I should discreetly dispose of it.
To urinate, etc. in water
Or places used by others is disgusting. [5.91]

I should not eat noisily or with my mouth open,
Or by cramming my mouth full.
I should not sit with my feet up
Or massage my shoulders with both hands at once. [5.92]

I should not be alone with a woman
When travelling, sleeping or staying somewhere.
I should know or find out whatever
Is disrespectful to the world and avoid it. [5.93]

I should never indicate by finger-pointing
But politely gesture towards things
With my right hand open.
This is also how I should show which way to go. [5.94]

I should not gesticulate wildly,
But express my point with slight movements,
Signalling with a click of the fingers, etc.
To do otherwise would be rude. [5.95]

I should sleep like the Protector passing into nirvāṇa—
Lying in the preferred direction.
With clear comprehension, I should resolve
To promptly rise early in the morning. [5.96]

Though it is taught
That bodhisattva conduct is limitless,
For now, I should actually practise
As much conduct as possible that purifies the mind. [5.97]

Three times each day and night,
I should recite the Sutra of the Three Heaps and
Pacify the residual downfalls
By relying upon the conquerors and bodhicitta. [5.98]

Regardless of whether it is one’s own or another’s training,
For any particular situation,
I should train with diligence
In whatever is taught for that situation. [5.99]

There is nothing that
The sons of the conquerors fail to train in.
For the wise, who always keep to this,
Nothing will fail to be meritorious. [5.100]

Whether directly or indirectly,
I should do nothing apart from benefitting beings.
‘So that this may only benefit beings,
I dedicate it all to enlightenment.’ [5.101]

The spiritual friend is learned in the Mahāyāna
And has mastered the discipline of the bodhisattvas.
I should never discard him, 
Even at the cost of my life. [5.102]

I should train in relying upon the teacher
As in the chapter of Śrisambhava.
This and the other instructions given by the Buddha
I should understand through reading the sutras. [5.103]

The trainings are found in the sutras,
So I should read the sutras.
The Ākāśagarbha Sutra
Is the one I should look at first. [5.104]

Because what is always to be practised
Is taught there very extensively,
I will be certain to also study
The Śikṣā-samuccaya. [5.105]

Otherwise I should study the Sutra-samuccaya.
I should also make an effort to study
These two works composed 
By Ārya Nāgārjuna. [5.106]

I should practise whatever is not
Prohibited there.
In order to protect worldly minds
I should fully practise what I have learnt. [5.107]

I should examine again and again
The conditions of body and mind.
This alone encapsulates
The key point of maintaining clear comprehension. [5.108]

I should put this into practice,
For what use are mere words?
Are sicknesses cured
Just by reading about the treatment? [5.109]

Chapter 6: Patience

All those good actions
Like giving and making offerings to the Sugatas,
Accumulated over a thousand aeons,
Are destroyed in an instant of anger. [6.1]

There is no nonvirtue like anger,
And no austerity like patience.
Therefore, in the various ways,
I should persevere in developing patience. [6.2]

If I hold on to thoughts afflicted by anger,
My mind will know no peace.
Having no happiness or pleasure,
I will be unsettled and unable to sleep. [6.3]

Some may depend on his favour
For wealth and status,
But even they will turn against
A hateful master and kill him. [6.4]

Friends and relatives will become fed up with him and,
Though drawn by his generosity, will not want to be around him.
In short, someone who stays angry
Will never be happy. [6.5]

It is the enemy, anger, which creates
Sufferings like these.
But whoever takes control and destroys anger
Will be happy in this life and future lives. [6.6]

It arises in the production of what I do not wish for,
And in the obstruction of what I wish.
Feeding on an unhappy mind,
Aggression grows and destroys me. [6.7]

Therefore, I should completely eliminate
The sustenance of this enemy—
An enemy which does nothing
But harm me. [6.8]

Whatever may befall me,
My joyful disposition will not be disturbed.
Being unhappy won’t accomplish any of my wishes
And my virtues will only deteriorate. [6.9]

If something can be done,
What’s the point of being unhappy?
If nothing can be done,
What good is it to be unhappy? [6.10]

For myself and my friends,
I want no suffering, no disrespect,
No criticism and nothing unpleasant.
For my enemies, I want the opposite. [6.11]

While the causes of happiness are few,
The causes of suffering are many.
Without suffering, there is no renunciation.
Therefore, mind, remain steady. [6.12]

The devotees of Gaurī and the practitioners of Karna
Undergo burns, cuts and so forth,
Enduring them patiently for no benefit. Yet, for the sake
Of liberation, why do I have no courage? [6.13]

There is nothing that does not
Become easier with habituation.
Therefore, by habituation to small difficulties,
I will have the patience for great difficulties. [6.14]

Who has not undergone the pointless sufferings
Of snake or insect bites,
Experiences of hunger and thirst,
And afflictions like skin inflammations? [6.15]

I should not be so sensitive
To heat, cold, rain, wind and so forth,
To sickness, confinement, blows and so forth—
Because that only magnifies their harm. [6.16]

Some, when they see their own blood,
Develop even greater courage and resolve.
Some, when they see the blood of another,
Feel faint and fall unconscious. [6.17]

These come from having a stable
Or a weak state of mind.
Therefore, disregarding harm,
I will be unaffected by suffering. [6.18]

Even when suffering occurs,
The wise should not let it disturb their peace of mind.
In battles with the defilements
There will be many injuries. [6.19]

Having disregarded all sufferings,
Enemies like aggression will be overcome.
Those who do so are the real conquering heroes—
The rest are just butchering corpses. [6.20]

Furthermore, suffering has good qualities:
Sadness dispels arrogance,
One feels compassion for those in saṃsāra,
Avoids nonvirtue and delights in virtue. [6.21]

I have no anger towards things like bile,
Though they can be great sources of suffering,
So why be angry with those which have a mind?
They are all just responding to conditions. [6.22]

Though they are unwanted,
Such sicknesses nevertheless occur.
Similarly, though they are unwanted,
Defilements stubbornly arise. [6.23]

They don’t think, ‘I’m going to get angry now’,
But people nevertheless get angry.
Similarly, it doesn’t think ‘I’m going arise now’,
But anger nevertheless arises. [6.24]

All the various negative actions
And all the many kinds of nonvirtue
Arise through the power of conditions.
They are not autonomous. [6.25]

Though there is a coming together of conditions,
There is no thought of, ‘I’m going to arise now.’
Nor does that which is produced
Have any thought of itself as produced. [6.26]

Some claim that there is a primal substance,
And they designate a ‘self’,
But it does not deliberately think,
‘I will arise now’, and then arise, [6.27]

And if that which has not arisen does not yet exist,
What in that moment wants to create itself?
Since it would immutably attend to its object,
It would never cease. [6.28]

Furthermore, if the self is sempiternal,
Like space, it is clearly not an agent.
Even if it encountered extraneous conditions,
Being immutable, what could it do? [6.29]

During creation, if it is as it was previously,
In what sense did it create the thing?
‘It was produced due to this [condition].’
Then what relation does the self have to the product? [6.30]

In this way, everything is extraneously controlled,
And not even the controllers have any power.
When this is recognized, I will not get angry
At things which are like apparitions. [6.31]

‘Who prevents what? It is illogical to prevent anything.’
Through reliance on such prevention, 
The stream of suffering will be cut.
There is no error in this. [6.32]

Therefore, regardless of friend or enemy,
When I see them behaving negatively,
Thinking, ‘This only comes from related conditions’,
I will remain happy. [6.33]

If it were true that we could achieve whatever we wanted,
Then, since among all living beings,
Nobody wants to suffer,
There would never be any suffering. [6.34]

Those who lack concern cause harm
Even to themselves, with weapons, etc.
And for the sake of what they might attain, such as women,
They go hungry, refuse food and so on. [6.35]

Some, by hanging themselves, jumping off precipices,
Taking poisonous or harmful food,
Or by unmeritorious actions,
Do harm to themselves. [6.36]

When the defilements are in control,
Even the precious self can be killed.
How, then, could they not
Do harm to the bodies of others? [6.37]

Even if I do not develop vast compassion
For those who, driven by defilements,
Resort to killing themselves and so forth in such ways,
How can I become angry? [6.38]

If it is in the nature of fools to cause harm to others,
Then it is wrong to be angry with them.
That is like getting angry with a flame
For having the nature to burn. [6.39]

On the other hand, if their faults are accidental,
Occurring despite their intrinsic nature, then it is wrong to be angry with them.
That is like getting angry with an empty space
For the presence of a cloud of incense. [6.40]

It is their weapons and so forth that are the direct instruments of harm,
So when I get angry with someone who strikes me,
It would make more sense to be angry with their aggression,
Since they are themselves driven by aggression. [6.41]

Previously, I caused sentient beings
Some similar kind of harm.
Therefore, it is only right that harm should come
To me, a doer of harm to sentient beings. [6.42]

His weapon and my own body
Jointly caused this suffering.
He drew the weapon, I brought the body:
Which of these should I be angry with? [6.43]

The human form is like an abscess:
It is unbearably sensitive and painful.
If, blinded by craving, I cling to it,
Who should I be angry with when I am harmed? [6.44]

If a fool does not want to suffer
But, nevertheless, is attached to its causes,
It is his own negative actions that are harming him,
So why fall out with others? [6.45]

It is like, for example, how the guardians of hell
Or the forest of razor leaves
Come from my own actions.
That, then, is who I should be angry with. [6.46]

Provoked by my own actions,
Beings come to harm me
But, in doing so, they fall into the hells.
Is it not I who am destroying them? [6.47]

In dependence upon them,
With patience, many nonvirtues are purified,
But in dependence upon me,
They fall into the hells for a long time. [6.48]

So if I am doing harm to them
But they are bringing benefit to me,
Do I not have it the wrong way round?
It is wrong of you, mind, to be angry. [6.49]

If I have the right attitude,
I will not go to the hells.
But if I only look after myself,
What does this do for them? [6.50]

However, if I return their harm,
That will not protect them either,
But it would damage my conduct,
And so destroy the discipline. [6.51]

Since the mind lacks physical form,
What could destroy it?
It is by attachment to the body
That I am harmed by physical suffering. [6.52]

If disrespectful words,
Harsh speech and criticism
Cannot harm the body,
Why, mind, do you fly into a rage? [6.53]

If contempt from others
Will not, in this life or future lives,
Destroy me,
Why am I so averse to it? [6.54]

I am averse to something
Because it hinders acquisition,
But the acquisitions of this life will be lost,
While the nonvirtues will firmly remain. [6.55]

It would be better to die today than to live a long life badly,
For although someone like me 
Might be around for a long time,
The suffering of death still awaits. [6.56]

Someone wakes from a dream
Of having a hundred years of happiness,
While another awakes having dreamt 
He had just a moment of happiness. [6.57]

Though they have both awoken,
The happiness of neither one will return.
No matter whether life is long or short,
At the moment of death, it is exhausted just the same. [6.58]

Though I may have gotten many acquisitions
And enjoyed happiness for a long time,
I will nevertheless go forth naked and empty-handed,
As if robbers had left me that way. [6.59]

‘But can’t I live off these acquisitions,
Exhausting nonvirtue and gathering merit?’
If I get angry over acquisitions,
Won’t that merit be exhausted in nonvirtue? [6.60]

What am I living for
If I am violating the very point of life?
Where is the meaning in living a life
In which there is only nonvirtue? [6.61]

‘It is because of the damage they do
By criticizing me that I get angry with beings.’
Then why do you not get angry like this
When they are criticizing others? [6.62]

You are patient with a loss of respect
When it depends on someone else,
So why not be patient with criticisms,
Since they are dependent upon the arising of the defilements. [6.63]

Although they may disparage or destroy
Statues, stupas or the holy dharma,
It is wrong for me to be angry,
For they have no power to harm the Buddhas and so forth. [6.64]

They may even harm my teachers,
Friends or relatives but,
Seeing these things arise from conditions,
As explained above, anger will be averted. [6.65]

If bodies with minds
And bodies without minds both do harm,
Why be angry only at those with minds?
I should be patient with their harm either way. [6.66]

If someone out of delusion does something wrong
And someone else out of delusion gets angry,
Which of them is without fault,
And which of them is at fault? [6.67]

Why did I previously commit actions
That make others harm me?
If it all comes down to my own actions,
Why get mad at others? [6.68]

Looking at it this way,
I should concentrate on increasing merit
And bringing about an attitude
Of mutual love between everyone. [6.69]

For example, when a fire consumes a house,
Before it spreads to another house,
One removes from it inflammables
Such as dry straw and so forth. [6.70]

Similarly, if the mind is attached to something,
The fire of aggression will spread there,
So I should remove it right now
Out of fear that merit will be consumed. [6.71]

Isn’t it better for a man to be freed with his hand chopped off
Than for him to be executed?
Isn’t it better, then, to experience human suffering
If it spares me from the hells? [6.72]

If I am unable now to bear
Even these slight sufferings,
Why do I not avert anger,
The cause of the sufferings of hell? [6.73]

Out of desire, I have undergone burning and so forth
In the hells, thousands upon thousands of times,
Without it doing anything meaningful for me
Or anything meaningful for others. [6.74]

Now, great benefit can be achieved
For a harm that is not even a tiny fraction of that.
I should only be joyful
In sufferings that dispel the harms of beings. [6.75]

If others take pleasure in
Praising someone’s good qualities,
Why, mind, do you find no joy
In praising them? [6.76]

The pleasure you would have
Would not infringe your vows but bring you happiness.
It is permitted by excellent ones,
And is the supreme gathering of others. [6.77]

‘But only others would have that happiness.’
If the happiness of others does not matter to you,
The visible and invisible will be lost,
Because of not paying them their wages and so forth. [6.78]

When they are describing my good qualities,
That’s when I want them to be happy, too,
But, when they are describing someone else’s good qualities,
That’s when their happiness doesn’t matter. [6.79]

Having generated bodhicitta
By wishing for the happiness of all sentient beings,
Why do I get angry
When beings find happiness by themselves? [6.80]

If I am claiming to want sentient beings to be
Enlightened objects of veneration in the three worlds,
Why, seeing them receive just some basic respect,
Am I aghast at the sight of it? [6.81]

If your relative who needs looking after,
And who relies on what you can provide for him,
Becomes able to look after himself,
Wouldn’t this make you joyful? Or would you get angry with him? [6.82]

Why would someone want enlightenment
If they do not want what is best for beings?
How can someone have bodhicitta
Who gets angry with the acquisitions of others? [6.83]

Regardless of whether he gets the thing
Or it stays in the donor’s house,
Either way, you won’t get it,
So what does it matter whether it is given away or not? [6.84]

Why did I reject merit,
Faith and good qualities?
Tell me why I am not angry with the one
Who did not take the opportunities for acquisitions? [6.85]

Not only are you not worried
About your own nonvirtues,
Do you also want to compete
With others who have gathered merit? [6.86]

Even if an enemy is unhappy,
What in that brings you happiness?
Your merely hoping for it
Cannot be a cause of his harm. [6.87]

Even if your wishes could bring him suffering,
What happiness is in it for you?
‘I would be satisfied.’
Could anything be more destructive than that? [6.88]

Those caught painfully on this sharp hook,
Cast by the angling defilements,
Will be cooked in the pots
Of the guardians of hell. [6.89]

The prestige of praise and reputation
Will bring no merit, nor extend my life,
Will not make me stronger, nor free me from sickness,
Nor will it bring any physical pleasure. [6.90]

If I care about what is good for me,
I should ask what use these things are.
If it is only a happy state of mind that I want,
I ought to turn to gambling, drinking, etc. [6.91]

If, for the sake of reputation,
They spend all their money and even get themselves killed,
What use will mere words be to them?
If they are dead, who is going to enjoy them? [6.92]

When their sandcastles collapse,
Children howl and cry.
Like them, when praise and reputation decline,
My mind is like a child’s. [6.93]

Because it has no consciousness,
A fleeting sound cannot consciously praise me.
‘But praising me makes someone else happy.
Is that not a cause of joy?’ [6.94]

What difference does it make to me
Whether their joy is based on me or someone else?
The happiness and joy belongs to them alone.
I will not get even a little bit of it. [6.95]

If his happiness gives me happiness,
Then it should do so in every case.
If it did, I would not be so unhappy
When someone is made happy by their joy in others. [6.96]

Therefore, it is the thought, ‘They are praising me’
That brings me joy.
This is really ridiculous.
It is the behaviour of a child. [6.97]

Praise and so forth only distract me.
They ruin my dissatisfaction with saṃsāra.
They make me envious of those who have something good,
And destroy anything that is excellent. [6.98]

Therefore, those who are at hand
To destroy my praise, etc.
Are they not in fact
Protecting me from the lower realms? [6.99]

The shackles of acquisition and honour
Are not needed for the pursuit of liberation,
So how can I be angry
With someone who frees me from them? [6.100]

They are like Buddhas bestowing blessings upon me—
Holding me back and bolting the door
As I try to run towards suffering.
How can I be angry with them? [6.101]

‘He is obstructing my merit.’
It is not right to be angry with him either,
For if there is no austerity equal to patience,
Shouldn’t I stick to it? [6.102]

It is my own fault
That I do not practise patience towards him
When the cause of merit is at hand,
So I am the only obstruction. [6.103]

If, without them, nothing happens but,
When they are present, it happens,
That person is a cause,
So how can I call them an obstruction? [6.104]

A beggar arriving during alms-giving
Is hardly an obstruction to giving,
And it would be absurd to say that an abbot
Is an obstruction to taking ordination. [6.105]

In this world, there are plenty of beggars,
But few who do us harm,
For unless I have harmed them,
They will not harm me. [6.106]

Therefore, like a treasure appearing
In my own home without my doing anything,
They help me practise the bodhisattva conduct,
So I should take joy in enemies. [6.107]

Both he and I are involved in this,
So the results of practising patience
Should be given to him first,
For he was the cause. [6.108]

‘But he did not intend for me to practise patience.
I should not have such respect for an enemy.’
He is nevertheless a cause of practice,
And do you not respect the holy dharma for the same thing? [6.109]

‘But my enemy really was intending to harm me,
So I should not respect him.’
If he was working for my benefit, like a doctor,
How could I practise patience? [6.110]

Therefore, since the arising of patience
Completely depends upon someone’s hostility,
That person is a cause of patience,
So I should respect him like I respect the holy dharma. [6.111]

Therefore, as the Sage has taught,
The field of sentient beings is a Buddha field.
Many have practised respect for them and,
In that way, completely crossed over. [6.112]

The Buddha qualities are established
Through sentient beings and Buddhas alike,
So how can I respect the conquerors
But not also respect sentient beings? [6.113]

It is not in their respective intentions
That they are equal but in their results.
It is in this sense that sentient beings have the qualities
Due to which they are like the Buddha. [6.114]

The greatness of sentient beings
Is there in venerating someone who has a loving mind.
The greatness of the Buddha
Is there in the merit of having faith in him. [6.115]

It is in respect of their producing the Buddha qualities
Therefore, that we hold them equal,
But none is equal to the Buddha,
Who has limitless oceans of qualities. [6.116]

His collection of supreme qualities is unequalled but,
If someone with just a fraction of those qualities were to appear,
Then to offer him even the three realms
Would be a small offering. [6.117]

Since sentient beings have a part in generating
The supreme Buddha qualities,
It is right to venerate them
Just for their doing this. [6.118]

Furthermore, apart from my dedication to sentient beings,
How can I ever repay
Their steadfast friendship
And their carrying out limitless benefit? [6.119]

If I am to repay the benefit
Of those who give up their bodies to enter the Avīci Hell,
I should do everything good for everyone,
Even if they do me great harm. [6.120]

If our masters sometimes act
Without regard even for their own bodies,
How can I, a confused person,
Have such conceit as to not be their servant? [6.121]

The sages are pleased when beings are made happy,
And displeased when they are harmed.
By bringing beings joy, we please all the sages but,
By harming beings, we harm the sages. [6.122]

Just as no object of desire could delight
Someone whose whole body is on fire,
So when sentient beings are harmed,
There is no way to please the great compassionate ones. [6.123]

Therefore, since I have harmed beings,
And displeased the great compassionate ones,
I now confess every one of those nonvirtues,
And ask the sages to be patient with everything I have done to displease them. [6.124]

To please the tathāgatas,
From now on I will serve the world.
Even if many beings kick me in the head, beat me
And try to kill me, I will not retaliate but will please the lords of the world. [6.125]

There is no doubt that the lords of compassion
Treat all beings as their own selves. I may see them as sentient beings
But the protectors see them as self. 
Why then do I have no respect? [6.126]

This is what pleases the tathāgatas,
And it perfectly accomplishes my own benefit.
It even dispels the world’s sufferings.
Therefore, I should always practise this. [6.127]

For example, though one of the king’s men
May harm many people,
The judicious people
Do not retaliate, even though they could. [6.128]

For he is not alone,
But his power is that of the king.
Similarly, I should not have contempt
For even the weakest of harm-doers, [6.129]

For they are supported by legions
Of hell-guardians and compassionate ones.
Therefore, like the subjects of a wrathful king,
I should try to placate sentient beings. [6.130]

If the king were to become angry
He could not bring the miseries of hell upon me.
Yet, that is what is brought about
By my harming sentient beings. [6.131]

On the other hand, if the king were to be pleased,
He could not bestow buddhahood upon me.
Yet, that is what is brought about
By my pleasing sentient beings. [6.132]

Quite apart from the fact that the future achievement of buddhahood
Comes from pleasing sentient beings,
Can I not see that patience brings good fortune,
Reputation and prosperity? [6.133]

In saṃsāra, patience brings beauty,
Good health and reputation,
A long life, and all the vast pleasures 
Of a universal emperor. [6.134]

Chapter 7: Effort

With such patience, I should undertake effort,
For there is enlightenment in effort.
Just as there is no movement without wind,
So there is no merit without effort. [7.1]

What is effort? Joy in virtue.
Its opposing factors are
Laziness, attachment to the negative
And the despondency of self-loathing. [7.2]

With the sweet taste of inactivity
And the craving for sleep,
I am not yet tired of the sufferings of saṃsāra,
So laziness arises. [7.3]

Hunted by the defilements,
I will be caught in the trap of rebirth,
And disappear into the jaws of the Lord of Death.
Do I understand this at all? [7.4]

Our kind are being gradually eradicated.
Can you not see that?
Those who go on sleeping regardless
Are like cattle before their butchers. [7.5]

Having blocked off all paths,
The Lord of Death is now looking for you.
How can you enjoy food?
How can you enjoy sleep? [7.6]

Since death is approaching fast,
How will I be able to accumulate merit?
At that time, even if I did abandon laziness,
It would be too late. What would be the point? [7.7]

When I haven’t done this, have just started this,
Am in the middle of this…
Suddenly the Lord of Death will come,
And I will cry, ‘Oh please no! It’s over!’ [7.8]

Overcome with misery, their eyes swollen and red,
Tears streaming down their faces,
My family will have lost all hope,
And all the while I will see the messengers from the Lord of Death. [7.9]

Tortured by the memories of my own nonvirtues
And hearing the immanent sounds of hell,
Terrified, I will clothe my body in excrement.
What could I possibly do in such a delirious state? [7.10]

If, in this life, you are terrified,
Like a fish flipping about out of water,
What can be said of the unbearable sufferings
Of hell, created by your own nonvirtues? [7.11]

How can you rest content,
Having done deeds which will lead to
The heating hells, where your tender flesh
Will be scalded by boiling water? [7.12]

Wanting the result but not wanting to make an effort,
Sensitive to all kinds of harm,
Like a god in the grip of death
You cry out, ‘I cannot stand this suffering!’ [7.13]

Cross the great river of suffering
Using the boat of human life.
Since this boat will be very difficult to find again,
Now is not the time for sleeping, you fool! [7.14]

Having given up the supreme joy of the holy dharma,
A limitless cause of joy,
How can you find joy in distractions
And agitations, which are causes of suffering? [7.15]

Without despondency, with the powers,
With dedication and self-control,
Equalizing myself and others,
I should then exchange myself and others. [7.16]

‘How can I possibly become enlightened?’
Don’t be so despondent.
The Tathāgata,
Whose words are true, said [7.17]

That even bees, mosquitoes,
Wasps and worms,
If they could develop the power of effort,
Would attain unsurpassable enlightenment, so hard to attain. [7.18]

Someone like me, born into humanity,
Recognizing what is of benefit and harm—
As long as I do not abandon the bodhisattva conduct,
Why would I not attain enlightenment? [7.19]

If I am more frightened at the prospect
Of having to lose an arm or a leg,
I have not examined what is heavy and what is light.
That fear comes from my own confusion. [7.20]

For countless millions of aeons,
Countless times I have been cut,
Impaled, burned and torn apart,
But I did not attain enlightenment. [7.21]

But the suffering through which I can accomplish
Enlightenment is limited.
It is like the suffering of making an incision
In order to extract something painful within. [7.22]

All physicians use unpleasant treatments
To cure illnesses.
So, to overcome many sufferings,
I can put up with a little unpleasantness. [7.23]

Yet, the supreme physician does not use
Ordinary treatments like these.
With his extremely gentle practice,
He cures the limitless number of great sicknesses. [7.24]

At first, the guide only has us practise
Giving away a few vegetables, etc.
Eventually, having gotten used to this,
We can come to give away even our own flesh. [7.25]

When I eventually come to regard my own body
As like those vegetables, etc.
Why would it be difficult
To give away its flesh? [7.26]

There is no suffering because nonvirtue is given up.
There is no lack of joy because of wisdom.
It is wrong understanding that harms the mind
And nonvirtues that harm the body. [7.27]

Merit brings physical pleasure,
And wisdom brings mental happiness.
Are the compassionate ones fed up
With remaining in saṃsāra for the benefit of others? [7.28]

Their former nonvirtues are exhausted
By the force of their bodhicitta,
And they gather oceans of merit,
Due to which they surpass the śrāvakas. [7.29]

Therefore, riding the chariot of bodhicitta,
Which relieves all discouragement and fatigue,
And takes one from happiness to happiness,
What thinking person would be despondent? [7.30]

The powers that can accomplish the benefit of beings
Are motivation, steadfastness, joy and rest.
Motivation is developed through fear of suffering
And considering its benefits. [7.31]

Therefore, give up the factors that oppose
Motivation, pride, joy and rest,
And with dedication and self-control,
Work to increase effort. [7.32]

I will overcome the endless faults
Of myself and others,
Even if each one of those faults
Takes an ocean of aeons to wear out. [7.33]

When I see that I have barely begun
To exhaust my own faults,
Why do I not have a heart attack, thinking
I will end up in the realms of limitless suffering? [7.34]

I will establish the many good qualities
Of myself and others,
Even if each one of those qualities
Takes an ocean of aeons to cultivate. [7.35]

Since I have never developed
Much familiarity with even a part of those qualities,
It is quite amazing that I, someone who has acquired
Such a rare rebirth, should act so meaninglessly. [7.36]

I have not made offerings to the Buddhas,
Nor provided great feasts.
I have not done anything for the teachings,
Nor fulfilled the wishes of the poor. [7.37]

I have not protected the frightened from what threatens them,
Nor given comfort to the destitute.
The only thing I have done is cause my mother 
The pain and suffering of carrying me in her womb. [7.38]

In the past, until now,
I have had no motivation for dharma,
And now I am destitute like this.
Who would abandon the motivation for dharma? [7.39]

Motivation is the source
Of all virtuous pursuits, as the Sage has said.
The source of motivation is continual meditation
On the ripening of results. [7.40]

Sufferings, anxieties,
All kinds of distress,
And being separated from our desires
All come from nonvirtue. [7.41]

For one who keeps a virtuous intent in mind,
No matter where he goes,
His merit will present offerings to him
With the gifts of ripening results. [7.42]

But one who practises nonvirtue, though he may want happiness,
No matter where he goes,
Will be defeated by his nonvirtues,
Bearing instruments for inflicting pain. [7.43]

In the vast, fragrant, cool heart of a lotus,
Where the sound of the Conqueror’s words nurtures their resplendence,
The virtuous, prompted by the Sage’s light, arise from a lotus in a supreme form
And become children of the Sugatas in the presence of the Conqueror. [7.44]

For the nonvirtuous, the servants of the Lord of Death will relentlessly flail all the skin from their bodies,
And pour molten copper, liquefied by ferocious furnaces, down their throats.
As one hundred chunks of flesh are gouged from them with red hot swords and knives,
They will fall upon the fiercely blazing iron ground. [7.45]

Therefore, I should be motivated to virtue,
And develop enthusiasm for it.
I should cultivate pride from the outset
According to the practice of Vajradhvaja. [7.46]

I should assess my own resources
Before deciding whether or not to undertake something.
It is better not to undertake it
Than to undertake it and then stop, [7.47]

For that habit will continue in future lives,
And increase nonvirtue and suffering.
Also, other actions and their results
Will be weakened and will not be accomplished. [7.48]

I should take pride in three things:
Actions, defilements and ability.
‘I will do it alone.’
This is pride in actions. [7.49]

The world is overpowered by defilements
And cannot achieve its own benefit.
Since beings cannot do it for themselves,
I will do it for them. [7.50]

How can I just sit here
When others are performing negative actions?
I don’t act because of pride,
But it would be better not to have such pride. [7.51]

When it comes across a dying snake,
A crow acts as if it were an eagle.
Similarly, when I am weakened,
Even a small downfall will harm me. [7.52]

When I am discouraged, I give up,
So how will I ever be liberated from destitution?
The proud, generating exertion,
Can handle difficulties, even great ones. [7.53]

Therefore, with a steady mind,
I will overcome all downfalls,
For if I am defeated by the defilements,
My wish to conquer the three realms would be a joke. [7.54]

‘I will conquer all,
And be conquered by nothing.’
I, a child of conquering lions,
Should take pride in this. [7.55]

Whoever is defeated by their pride
Does not have this pride; he has defilements.
The proud are not overpowered by their enemies;
They bring the enemy pride under their power. [7.56]

Their defilements inflate them with pride,
And their pride leads them to the lower realms.
It steals the wealth of their human life,
And leaves them a slave, begging food from others, [7.57]

Stupid, ugly and pathetic, despised wherever they go.
If these wretches, inflated with pride,
Are counted among the proud,
Who could be considered shamed? [7.58]

Whoever takes pride in conquering the enemy pride
Is one of the proud and a completely victorious hero.
Whoever finally overcomes the enemy pride when it is upon him
Brings the results of his conquest to completion in accord with the wishes of beings. [7.59]

Amid the amassing defilements,
I will withstand them in a thousand ways.
Like a lion among foxes,
The host of defilements will not disturb me. [7.60]

In a deadly situation,
People protect their eyes.
Similarly, even in a threatening situation,
I will not fall under the power of the defilements. [7.61]

It would be better to be burned alive
Or decapitated
Than to be constantly grovelling
To the enemy defilements.
Similarly, in all circumstances,
I should do nothing other than what is appropriate. [7.62]

Whatever actions are to be done, I will carry them out
Like someone who enjoys the playing 
Of a game as its own reward;
I will insatiably delight in participating. [7.63]

When we act for the sake of our own happiness,
We do not know whether we will get it or not.
But how can one for whom the action itself brings happiness
Be happy without doing it? [7.64]

If I never have enough sense pleasures,
Which are like honey on a razor’s edge,
How can I ever have enough merit,
Which ripens in happiness and bliss? [7.65]

Therefore, in order to carry out an action,
I will engage in it
Like an elephant tormented by the midday sun,
Plunging into a lake. [7.66]

If, after some time, my strength declines,
I should leave it so I can return to it later.
When I have completed something properly,
I should leave it, wanting to get on with the next thing. [7.67]

Like engaging in a sword fight
With a veteran enemy warrior,
I will dodge the defilement weapons
And cut down the defilement enemies. [7.68]

If I dropped my sword in battle,
I would hurriedly snatch it up, horrified.
Likewise, if I lose the blade of mindfulness,
I will quickly restore it, in horror of hell. [7.69]

Poison spreads throughout the body
By means of the blood.
Likewise, if they find an opportunity
Faults will spread throughout my mind. [7.70]

Practitioners should be as careful
As someone carrying a pot of mustard oil,
Attended by a knifeman
Threatening to kill them if they should spill any. [7.71]

I would hurriedly jump up
If a snake slid onto my lap.
Likewise, if I sink into sleep or lethargy,
I will quickly repel them. [7.72]

Each time some fault occurs,
I should reproach myself,
Reflecting for a long time,
‘I will not allow this to happen again.’ [7.73]

‘How can I develop mindfulness
In these particular circumstances?’
With this in mind, I should plan for
Occasions of meeting and practising. [7.74]

Before committing any act,
I should be fully prepared.
Calling to mind the advice on concern,
I should proceed to carry it out. [7.75]

Like cotton blown back and forth
Under the power of the wind,
I should accomplish everything in this way
Under the power of enthusiasm. [7.76]

Chapter 8: Meditation

Having developed effort in this way,
I should place my mind in samādhi.
Someone whose mind is distracted
Lives between the jaws of the defilements. [8.1]

With the isolation of body and mind,
There are no distractions.
Therefore, I should abandon this world,
And give up all conceptual discrimination. [8.2]

Out of attachment and craving for possessions, etc.
I do not abandon this world.
Therefore, to completely abandon it,
The wise should analyse it as follows. [8.3]

Understanding that insight with complete calm abiding
Will utterly destroy the defilements,
I should seek calm abiding first,
And that is achieved through the joy of freedom from worldly attachment. [8.4]

Which impermanent person would have attachment
To another impermanent person?
He will not see his loved one again
For thousands of lifetimes. [8.5]

I am unhappy when I don’t see them
And my mind will not settle.
Yet, even when I see them, I am not satisfied,
But just as tormented by craving as before. [8.6]

If one is attached to sentient beings,
Reality is obscured,
Renunciation is forgotten,
And one ends up suffering in misery. [8.7]

Thinking solely of them,
This life passes by without any meaning.
The unchanging dharma
Is lost through transient friends. [8.8]

If I act like a fool,
I will surely go to the lower realms.
If they are leading me to that different end,
Why would I follow such fools? [8.9]

One second they are friends
But, in an instant, they become enemies.
Since they get angry even in joyful situations,
People are very hard to please. [8.10]

If I say something helpful, they get angry,
And oppose my help.
If I don’t listen to them, they get angry, 
And then will go to a bad rebirth. [8.11]

They are envious of superiors, competitive towards equals,
And arrogant towards inferiors. When praised, they become conceited.
When criticized, they get angry.
What good can ever come from such children? [8.12]

When associating with the childish,
We praise ourselves and criticize other children,
And nonvirtues, like discussing
The joys of saṃsāra, inevitably occur. [8.13]

To associate with others like this
Only brings loss.
Therefore, since I will not benefit them,
And they will not benefit me, [8.14]

I should stay far away from childish people.
When I come across them, I should be happy to please them.
Without being very familiar,
I should treat them well just like any ordinary person. [8.15]

Like a bee taking nectar from a flower,
I should accept only what is for the dharma.
I should remain unfamiliar,
As if they were someone I had never met before. [8.16]

‘I have lots of possessions and respect.
I am really popular.’
If I hold on to such thoughts,
My death will be horrible. [8.17]

Therefore, whatever it is
That this utterly confused mind desires,
Along with it comes
A thousand sufferings. [8.18]

Therefore, the wise don’t have desires.
Fear comes from desire.
Since it is the nature of things to be let go of,
I will be firm and recognize this well. [8.19]

I may have many possessions,
And I may be famous and praised,
But these possessions and fame—
I don’t know what will become of them. [8.20]

Why does someone’s praise please me,
When there is someone else to criticize me?
Why does someone’s criticism displease me,
When there is someone else to praise me? [8.21]

If even the Conqueror could not satisfy
The various inclinations of sentient beings,
What can one say of a wretch like me?
Therefore, I will give up thinking about worldly people. [8.22]

They look down on those who have no possessions,
And complain about those who have them.
Since they are so difficult to get along with,
How can they bring me any joy? [8.23]

The Tathāgata said,
‘Since the childish are not happy
Unless they are benefitting themselves,
The childish are friends to no one.’ [8.24]

In the forest, the deer, birds
And trees do not speak unpleasantly.
When will I come to live among
Such good company? [8.25]

Staying in caves or deserted shrines,
Or at the foot of a tree—
I will not look back
But will be free from attachment. [8.26]

When will I come to live
In naturally spacious places,
Not claimed by anyone as their own,
Free to do as I please, without attachment? [8.27]

Having just a begging bowl and a few things,
Wearing clothes not wanted by anyone,
Not even having to conceal this body—
When will I come to live without worry? [8.28]

When will I go to the burial ground, where,
Between my body and those heaps of bones,
There is no difference
In our subjection to disintegration? [8.29]

That is where this body of mine will end up,
With a stink so putrid
That not even the wolves
Will want to go near it. [8.30]

If the very flesh and bones
That comprise my body
Must come apart,
What can be said of friendships? [8.31]

When we are born, we are born alone.
When we die, we die alone.
If they cannot relieve us of our burden of suffering,
What do friends do but create obstacles? [8.32]

As travellers on the roads
Take their places to stay,
So, on the paths of conditioned existence,
All take their places of birth. [8.33]

While everyone is completely grief-stricken,
Four pallbearers carry someone away.
Before that time comes for me,
I will go to the forest. [8.34]

I will stay alone in isolation,
Somewhere without friends or antagonists.
When I die, since they will already think of me as dead,
I won’t cause them any distress. [8.35]

And since they won’t be around me,
Being miserable and causing problems,
Nobody will be able to distract me
From mindfulness of the Buddha and so on. [8.36]

Therefore, I will go to live
In the bright, beautiful forest where,
With few problems, happy and content,
All disturbances will be pacified. [8.37]

Giving up all other purposes,
I will endeavour single-mindedly
To place my mind in meditative equipoise
And subdue it. [8.38]

In this world and in the next,
Our desires bring us only ruin.
Here, we are killed, imprisoned and broken,
And in the next, we go to the hells. [8.39]

To get her, you had entreated her,
With messengers, male and female,
Without any thought
For nonvirtue or shame. [8.40]

You would do things that terrified you,
Waste your wealth and,
When she was finally in your arms,
Were overjoyed with what was really [8.41]

Nothing but a skeleton,
With neither autonomy nor self.
But because of your intense desire and attraction to her,
You did not go beyond suffering. [8.42]

At first, you tried to get her
To raise her face to you but, modestly, she looked down.
Whether anyone could see her or not,
She covered her face with a veil. [8.43]

That face, which so concerned you,
Is right there before you now,
For the vultures have stripped it bare—
So why do you run away? [8.44]

When someone looked at her,
You would completely shield her face from him,
But now that the vultures are eating that face away,
Why, selfish, don’t you protect it? [8.45]

Seeing this pile of flesh
Being eaten by vultures and other creatures,
Why don’t you go and present to their food
Those flower garlands, sandalwood and ornaments? [8.46]

If you are afraid of a mere pile of bones,
Even though it cannot possibly move,
Why are you not frightened
By something that stirs like a zombie? [8.47]

You wanted it when it was covered.
Why don’t you want it now it is uncovered?
If you have no need of it now,
Why did you want it then? [8.48]

If excrement and saliva
Come from the same source—food,
Why do you love her saliva,
But not her excrement? [8.49]

You don’t have any love for your pillow
Of soft cotton but,
Telling yourself she doesn’t really stink,
Your desire confuses you about what is impure. [8.50]

Those confused, desirous wretches,
Though their pillows are soft,
Get angry, saying,
‘I can’t copulate with this!’ [8.51]

If you aren’t attracted to impurity,
Why do you embrace
A cage of bones joined by ligaments,
And plastered over with flesh? [8.52]

You yourself have plenty of impurity,
Which you continually have to experience,
And yet you hungrily chase after the filth of others
Though they, too, are bags of impurity. [8.53]

‘It’s just their flesh I enjoy.’
If that is what you want to see and touch,
Do you want it in its natural state,
Devoid of a mind? [8.54]

The mind that you desire
Cannot be seen or touched,
So it makes no sense to want to copulate with it.
What can be seen and touched is not conscious. [8.55]

It is unremarkable to misunderstand
The impure nature of other bodies,
But it is very remarkable to misunderstand
The impurity you yourself have. [8.56]

Not noticing a young lotus flower,
Spreading its petals in the sunlight on a cloudless day,
Why is the mind so attracted to impurity,
And drawn to cages of impurity? [8.57]

If you don’t want to touch
An area covered in excrement,
Why do you want to touch
The body it issued from? [8.58]

If you are not attracted to impurity,
Why do you want to copulate with the body parts of others,
Which came from an impure place,
And developed from an impure seed. [8.59]

You are not attracted to
A tiny grub, born on excrement.
Yet, you are attracted to bodies which have many natural impurities,
And are even born from impurities. [8.60]

Not only do you not mind
The impurity of your own body,
But, wanting even more impurity,
You desire other bags of impurity, too. [8.61]

When pleasing substances like camphor,
Rice or cooked vegetables
Are spat out after chewing,
Even the ground is considered dirty. [8.62]

Though such impurity is quite obvious,
If there are any doubts about it,
Take a look at the bodies in the cemetery.
You can see even more impurity there. [8.63]

If someone’s skin were to be peeled away,
You would be completely horrified.
You know this, so how can you
Ever be attracted to such a thing again? [8.64]

Scents applied to the body
Are of sandalwood and so forth, nothing else.
Why are you attracted to things
That smell of something else? [8.65]

The body’s natural smell is awful.
Isn’t it right not to be attracted to it? 
Why do the worldly, craving something meaningless,
Daub it with a fragrance? [8.66]

For, if the fragrance is that of sandalwood,
How could it come from the body?
Why are you attracted to things
That smell of something else? [8.67]

The body in its natural state,
With long hair and nails,
With stinking, grey teeth, covered with foul-smelling dirt,
And naked, is actually frightening. [8.68]

Why make such an effort to clean up
Something that is like a weapon for wounding me?
This world is in chaos with lunatics, 
Frantic in their self-centred confusion. [8.69]

Having seen a few skeletons in the cemetery,
You felt revulsion.
So are you happy in this cemetery city,
Full of moving skeletons? [8.70]

In this way, you cannot have
Such impurity without paying a price.
For those who get it, exhaustion
And agonies such as those of hell ensue. [8.71]

Children cannot amass any wealth,
And the young cannot enjoy it.
When life is wasted chasing them,
What use are those desires to the old? [8.72]

Some miserable people, full of desire,
Are completely worn out at the end of a long day.
They come home and collapse,
Their lifeless bodies sleeping like the dead. [8.73]

Some are afflicted by travelling,
And have to suffer being far from home.
Though they miss their families,
They will not see them for years on end. [8.74]

Some confused ones, wanting to help themselves,
Sell whatever they have but,
Without getting what they wanted, are driven aimlessly
By the winds of others’ karma. [8.75]

Some sell their own bodies,
And are helplessly exploited by others.
If his wife should give birth, she must do so
At the foot of a tree or in whatever remote place she finds herself. [8.76]

Fools, deceived by their desire,
Want a livelihood and, thinking they will make a living,
Join the army, though they are afraid of dying,
Or enter into servitude for money. [8.77]

Some desirous people can be seen with broken bodies,
Or impaled upon stakes,
Or pierced by blades,
Or even burned. [8.78]

Due to the anxieties of getting, keeping and losing wealth,
Understand that its problems are endless.
Those who become distracted by attachment to wealth
Have no opportunity for liberation from the sufferings of saṃsāra. [8.79]

Those who have desire for such things
Will have many problems and little satisfaction.
They are like beasts pulling a wagon,
Able to eat just a few mouthfuls of grass. [8.80]

For the sake of something that gives little satisfaction
And which so common that even animals can get it,
Those tormented by their karma waste the magnificent freedoms and endowments
That they had acquired with such difficulty. [8.81]

The objects of desire will inevitably perish,
But I will fall into the hells and so forth.
For the sake of something not very important,
I have been wearing myself out. [8.82]

If buddhahood itself can be attained
With just a millionth of that difficulty,
Having desire is much more suffering
Than practising the bodhisattva conduct but without any enlightenment. [8.83]

When one thinks about the sufferings of the hells,
The dangers of weapons, poisoning, fires, ravines
And enemies are nothing
Compared to the objects of desire. [8.84]

Disillusioned with the objects of desire,
I will develop joy in solitude.
In peaceful forests,
With no conflict or defilements, [8.85]

Fortunate ones, cooled by sandalwood moonlight,
Stroll and contemplate the benefit of others,
Among wondrous palaces of immense rocks,
As a silent, soothing forest breeze blows. [8.86]

In an empty hut, at the foot of a tree or in a cave,
They stay as long as they want.
They have left behind the sufferings of masters and protection and,
Not reliant on anyone, live carefree. [8.87]

Free and without attachment,
Not tied to anyone,
They live with a contentment and happiness
That even Indra would have difficulty finding. [8.88]

Having considered how solitude
Has such good qualities,
I should pacify conceptual discrimination
And meditate on bodhicitta. [8.89]

Equalizing self and others
Is the first thing to try and cultivate.
Since everyone is the same when it comes to happiness
And suffering, I should look after them as I do myself. [8.90]

Just as the whole body should be protected,
Though it has many different parts—hands and so on,
So different beings, whether happy or suffering,
All want to be happy, just as I do. [8.91]

Though my suffering doesn’t harm
The bodies of others,
Nevertheless, it is my suffering,
And clinging to it as ‘mine’ makes it intolerable to me. [8.92]

Similarly, though the suffering of others
Does not befall me,
Nevertheless, it is my suffering,
And clinging to it as ‘mine’ will make it hard for me to tolerate. [8.93]

I should expel the suffering of others
Because it is suffering, like my own suffering,
And I should benefit others
Because they are sentient beings, like I am. [8.94]

When you and I
Are the same in wanting to be happy,
What is so special about me
That I work only for myself? [8.95]

When you and I
Are the same in not wanting to suffer,
What is so special about me
That I look after myself and not you? [8.96]

‘Their suffering doesn’t hurt me,
So why should I care about them?’
Future sufferings don’t hurt you either,
So why protect yourself from them? [8.97]

To think, ‘I’m the one who will experience it’,
Is a mistake.
It is someone else who dies after this,
And someone else again who is born. [8.98]

‘The ones with the suffering
Should look after themselves.’
The suffering of the feet is not that of the hands,
So why should the hands protect them? [8.99]

‘It may not be right,
But I do it out of self-clinging.’
Neither self nor other is right:
You should try to give them both up. [8.100]

A ‘stream’ and a ‘composite’ are false,
Like a string of beads or an army.
Suffering is not owned by anyone,
So, who should be the one to remove it? [8.101]

Sufferings have no owner:
None of them is unique.
If it is suffering, it should be eradicated.
Why be inconsistent about this? [8.102]

There is no disagreement about the reason
For preventing everyone’s suffering.
If you prevent it at all, prevent it for all.
Otherwise, don’t do it for anyone. [8.103]

‘Compassion will bring me a lot of suffering,
So why should I develop it?’
If you think about the sufferings of living beings,
How can compassion be considered a lot of suffering? [8.104]

If one person’s suffering
Can stop many sufferings,
A kind-hearted person would take on that suffering
For his own sake and the sake of others. [8.105]

It was for this reason that Supuśpacandra,
Though he knew the king would harm him,
Did not evade his own suffering
In order to exhaust many sufferings. [8.106]

One who cultivates this in their being,
With the joy of pacifying the suffering of others,
Would enter the Avīci Hell
As if they were diving into a lotus pool. [8.107]

When sentient beings are completely liberated,
It is an ocean of joy.
Is that not enough?
What use is it wanting my own liberation? [8.108]

In this respect, though I am benefitting others,
I will do it without conceit or thinking it is a big deal.
By taking joy solely in their benefit,
I will not expect the ripening of any results. [8.109]

Therefore, just as I protect myself
From the slightest criticism,
So I should have a protective attitude towards others,
And a compassionate intent. [8.110]

Just as out of habit I regard
The drops of semen and blood
Of others as ‘myself’,
Even though they have no substance, [8.111]

Why don’t I regard the bodies of others
As ‘myself’ in the same way, too?
Nor should it be hard to see
My own body as theirs, too. [8.112]

Having recognized that self is defective,
While others are an ocean of good qualities,
I should completely abandon self-clinging
And practise embracing others. [8.113]

Just as I regard my hands, etc.
As parts of my body,
Why don’t I regard embodied beings
As limbs of one life? [8.114]

Just as habituation has brought about
The idea of self for this selfless body,
Why should habituation not create
The same idea about sentient beings? [8.115]

Though I might benefit others in this way,
I will not have conceit or think it is a big deal,
Like not expecting a reward
After eating my own food. [8.116]

Therefore, just as I protect myself
From the slightest criticism,
So I should have a protective attitude towards beings,
And cultivate a compassionate intent. [8.117]

The protector Avalokiteśvara,
Out of great compassion
Blessed even his own name
To dispel the fear of crowds. [8.118]

I shouldn’t turn away from difficulty.
Just hearing someone’s name might have once frightened me but,
By the power of habituation,
I will come to be disappointed at their absence. [8.119]

Whoever wants quickly
To protect himself and others
Should practise the holy secret:
Exchanging self and others. [8.120]

Out of attachment to my body,
I am frightened by the slightest threat.
Who would not resent as an enemy
A body which creates so much fear? [8.121]

Wanting to alleviate the body’s
Hunger and thirst, or its sickness,
Someone kills a bird, fish or deer,
Or lies in ambush by the roadside. [8.122]

For the sake of wealth and status,
Someone kills his father and mother,
Or steals the offerings made to the Three Jewels and,
Because of this, burns in the Avīci Hell. [8.123]

Who, then, would be wise
To cherish, protect and lavish gifts upon that body?
Who would not see it as their enemy,
And regard it with contempt? [8.124]

‘If I give this, what will I have?’
Thinking of one’s own benefit is the way of demons.
‘If I keep this, what will I give?’
Thinking of the benefit of others is the dharma of the gods. [8.125]

If I harm others for my own sake,
I will be tormented in the hells and so forth but,
If I am harmed for the sake of others,
I will attain everything I could possibly want. [8.126]

If I desire a high status for myself,
I will go to the lower realms, lowly and stupid but,
If I wish it for others,
I will obtain a happy rebirth and every honour. [8.127]

If I use others for my own sake,
I will come to know servitude and so forth myself but,
If I work for the sake of others,
I will come to experience a high status and so forth. [8.128]

Whatever happiness there is in this world
All comes from wanting others to be happy.
Whatever suffering there is in this world
All comes from wanting one’s own happiness. [8.129]

Does this need to be explained any further?
Just look at the difference between
The childish, who pursue their own benefit,
And the Buddhas, who carry out the benefit of others. [8.130]

If I do not actually exchange
My happiness for the suffering of others,
Not only will I not attain buddhahood but,
Even in saṃsāra, I will find no happiness. [8.131]

Even apart from my future lives,
Nothing would get done in this life:
Servants would fail to do their work
And masters would refuse to pay them. [8.132]

Completely discarding the abundant joy and contentment
Of achieving both visible and invisible happiness
And, instead, being a cause of suffering for others,
In confusion, I am bringing unbearable suffering upon myself. [8.133]

All the dangerous forces in the world
And as much fear and suffering as there is,
Come from self-grasping,
So what good is this great demon to me? [8.134]

If I don’t give it up completely,
I cannot avoid suffering,
Just as if I don’t put out a fire,
I cannot avoid being burnt. [8.135]

Because it will, in this way, pacify harm to myself
And pacify the sufferings of others,
I will give myself up for others,
And embrace others as I did the self. [8.136]

‘I am under the control of others.’
With this conviction, mind,
You will now have no thought
Other than benefitting all sentient beings. [8.137]

Since my eyes, etc. are controlled by others,
It is not right for them to accomplish my benefit.
Since my eyes, etc. are for their benefit,
It is not right for them to do any harm. [8.138]

Therefore, I should put sentient beings first.
Anything I see on my body
Should be taken away from it
And used to help others. [8.139]

Taking my inferiors, etc. as self;
And taking self as other,
With a disinterested mind,
I will meditate on envy, competitiveness and pride. [8.140]

He gets respect, but I don’t.
I don’t have any wealth like his.
He is praised while I am criticized.
He is happy while I am suffering. [8.141]

I have to work
While he sits back comfortably.
He is renowned in the world as great,
While I am his inferior, with no good qualities. [8.142]

How can I have no good qualities?
Everyone has good qualities.
Compared to some, he is inferior.
Compared to some, I am superior. [8.143]

My degenerate view, moral conduct and so on
Are not my fault but are due to the power of the defilements.
He should do whatever he can to help me;
I accept this may cause some pain. [8.144]

Why does he not help me,
But only criticize me?
What use are his qualities to me,
When he keeps them for himself? [8.145]

He has no compassion for beings
Living precariously at the mouth of the lower realms.
Conceited in how his own qualities compare to others,
He wants to outrival the learned. [8.146]

Though he is regarded as my equal,
I should be his superior,
So I will acquire wealth and respect
Even if it brings conflict. [8.147]

I will do what I can to make my own good qualities
Apparent to the whole world,
And make sure nobody has heard of
His good qualities. [8.148]

I will hide my own faults
And everyone will praise me instead of him.
From now on, I will get all the wealth,
And they will respect me instead of him. [8.149]

I will happily watch for a long time,
As he is unfairly treated.
Everyone will laugh at him
And we will all agree he is contemptible. [8.150]

I hear this miserable wretch
Is trying to compete with me.
How can he equal me in learning, wisdom,
Looks, intelligence or wealth? [8.151]

When they hear of my good qualities,
Which everyone talks about,
I will really enjoy the pleasant feeling
Of a tingling sensation. [8.152]

In case he has something of his own,
As long as he works for me,
I will force him to give it to me,
And he will get just enough to live on. [8.153]

I will constantly deprive him of happiness
And inflict harm upon him.
While I have been wandering in saṃsāra,
He has hurt me hundreds of times. [8.154]

Wanting to benefit yourself, mind,
Countless aeons have been wasted.
Now you are exhausted,
And you have achieved only suffering. [8.155]

Those who decisively engage
In truly benefitting others,
In future will, as the Sage has incontrovertibly said,
Know the excellence of having done so. [8.156]

If, in the past, you had acted this way,
Your current predicament,
Devoid of the magnificent bliss of buddhahood,
Would not have come about. [8.157]

Therefore, just as you grasp as self
The drops of semen and blood from others,
So you should regard all others as self
Through habitual practice. [8.158]

On the lookout for others,
If you see something on the self’s body,
Steal it from him
And use it to benefit others. [8.159]

‘I am happy but others are unhappy.
I have a high status but others are low.
I help myself but never others.’
Why am I not envious of myself? [8.160]

I will go without my own happiness,
And instead take on the sufferings of others.
I will examine my own faults, thinking,
‘What should I do here?’ [8.161]

Although others have their faults,
I will treat them as my own faults but,
When I do something even slightly at fault,
I will admit it openly. [8.162]

Letting the reputations of others
Eclipse my own,
I will work for the benefit of all
Like the lowliest servant. [8.163]

Imperfection is in my nature,
So don’t praise me for some accidental quality.
Should I even have such a quality,
Nobody needs to know about it. [8.164]

In short, let whatever harm
You have selfishly inflicted on others
Fall upon yourself
For the sake of sentient beings. [8.165]

Don’t be overbearing,
With an arrogant manner.
Have manners like a new bride:
Be modest, apprehensive and restrained. [8.166]

That which is to be kept
And that which is to be avoided
Should be under your control.
Transgressions should be subjugated. [8.167]

Despite being given such advice,
If you, mind, do not practise accordingly,
You will be the source of the faults,
So it is you who will be subjugated. [8.168]

Though you have destroyed me,
That is in the past. That time is over.
Now I have seen you, where can you go?
I am going to completely crush your arrogance. [8.169]

Also, give up any idea
Of benefitting yourself.
Since I have handed you over to others,
Stop complaining and get to work. [8.170]

In case I lose concern
And fail to hand you over to sentient beings,
Then no doubt you will hand me over
To the guardians of hell. [8.171]

That is how you have betrayed me before:
Handing me over to long-lasting misery.
Recalling my past resentments,
I will crush you, selfish mind. [8.172]

If I want joy,
I should not pursue my own joy.
If I want protection,
I should always protect others. [8.173]

The more I look after
This body,
The more sensitive
It becomes. [8.174]

Having become so sensitive,
The whole world will not be enough
To fulfil its wishes,
So who could give it what it wants? [8.175]

Unable to get what it wants,
The defilements grow and the mind deteriorates
But, for someone who does not need anything,
There is no end to his riches. [8.176]

Therefore, I should not allow opportunities
For the body’s desires to grow.
Not grasping attractive objects—
That is the best possession to have. [8.177]

In the end, this unclean form
Cannot prevent itself turning to dust.
Unable to move and moved only by others—
Why grasp that as ‘me’? [8.178]

What use is this contraption to me,
Living or dead?
What is special about this particular lump?
Why don’t I overcome pride? [8.179]

By cherishing the body,
I have gathered suffering for no purpose,
So why have attachment and aggression
Over something indistinguishable from a block of wood? [8.180]

Whether I am attending to its needs
Or it is being eaten by the vultures, etc.
It feels neither attachment nor anger,
And yet I have attachment to it. [8.181]

If it feels no
Anger when criticized
Nor happiness when praised,
What am I tiring myself out for? [8.182]

‘I am attached to this body
Because I am close to it.’
Since everyone is attached to their own body,
Why have I no joy for them? [8.183]

Therefore, I will give up this body
Without any attachment for the benefit of beings.
Therefore, though it has many faults,
I will keep it for use in this work. [8.184]

Therefore, no more childish behaviour.
I will follow the wise—
Remembering their words on concern,
I will fight off sleep and lethargy. [8.185]

Like the great, compassionate sons of the conquerors,
I will bear whatever must be done.
If I don’t work at this night and day,
When will my suffering ever end? [8.186]

Therefore, in order to dispel the obscurations,
I will withdraw my mind from its mistaken ways,
And continually rest in equipoise
Upon the perfect object. [8.187]

Chapter 9: Wisdom

All of these factors were taught
By the Sage for the sake of wisdom.
Therefore, those who wish to pacify sufferings
Should develop wisdom. [9.1]

Relative and ultimate: these are the two truths.
The ultimate is not within 
The domain of conceptual thought.
Conceptual thought is said to be relative delusion. [9.2]

We can see two types of people:
Buddhists and ordinary people.
The ordinary, worldly people
Are refuted by lower Buddhist schools. [9.3]

The Buddhists, too, have distinct schools of conceptual thought,
Of which there are higher and lower,
Who debate and agree upon examples,
While not abandoning conceptual thought in order to achieve the results. [9.4]

Worldly people see objects as existent
And discriminate them as reality,
Not as illusion-like. Therefore, on this,
Buddhists and worldly people are in dispute. [9.5]

When there is perception of forms and so forth,
That is a consensus, not a valid cognition.
If the consensus is that something unclean is clean,
Then it is a delusion to accord it. [9.6]

For the sake of introducing the worldly,
The protector taught in terms of existence. 
In suchness, there is not even momentary existence.
‘Then momentariness cannot be a relative truth.’ [9.7]

There is no error, for it is the Buddhist’s relative.
In comparison to the worldly, it is seeing reality.
Otherwise, the ascertainment that women are impure
Would be refuted by the worldly. [9.8]

The merit in relation to the illusion-like Conqueror
Is just as if he really existed.
‘If sentient beings are illusory,
How are they reborn after death?’ [9.9]

For as long as the conditions are assembled,
Even an illusion will continue to arise.
So how could sentient beings really be existent
Just because their continuity lasts for a long time? [9.10]

When illusory beings are killed,
There is no nonvirtue, because there was no mind.
Merit and nonvirtue originate
With those who possess an illusory mind. [9.11]

Since mantras and so on do not have that power,
Illusory minds do not arise from them.
Having arisen from a variety of conditions,
Illusions will vary too, [9.12]

But nowhere is there a single condition
With the ability to create them all.
‘The ultimate is nirvāṇa.
Saṃsāra is relative truth. In this way, [9.13]

If he is in saṃsāra despite being a Buddha,
What is the point of the bodhisattva conduct?’
If the continuity of conditions is not interrupted,
Even an illusion will not be dispelled. [9.14]

If the continuity of conditions is interrupted,
It will not arise, even as relative.
‘If even delusion does not exist,
What perceives the illusion?’ [9.15]

Since for you the illusion does not exist either,
What do you perceive?
‘They exist as if they were external,
But they are representations, which are mind itself.’ [9.16]

If the illusion is mind itself,
Then what is seen by what?
The protector of the world has taught
That mind does not see mind. [9.17]

Just as the blade of a sword
Cannot cut itself, so it is with the mind.
‘It is like a lamp—self-illuminating.’ [9.18]

That lamp could never be illuminated,
For it was never cloaked in darkness.
‘The blue of a crystal, etc. depends on something external,
While naturally blue objects do not depend on anything. [9.19]

Similarly, seeing is in some cases other-dependent,
And in other cases, independent.’
Something already blue
Cannot make itself blue. [9.20]

A lamp, when cognized by a cognition,
May be designated ‘that which illuminates’,
But what do you claim cognizes
The mind as ‘illuminating itself’? [9.21]

If it is not seen by anyone,
Then whether it is illuminating or not
Is like the looks of a barren woman’s daughter—
Discussing it is meaningless. [9.22]

‘If self-awareness did not exist,
How could consciousness be remembered?’
Memory comes from its connection to another experience,
Like deducing a rat bite from an infection. [9.23]

‘Since, under the right conditions, a mind can see
That of others, how can it not see itself?’
Through applying the eye lotion of accomplishment,
One will see a vase and not the eye lotion itself. [9.24]

Cognitions of seeing and hearing
Are not the objects of negation here.
Here, we are preventing the cause of suffering: 
Their discrimination as real. [9.25]

Illusions are not other than mind
But you do not think of them as identical.
If they were real, they would have to be other than mind but,
If they are not other than mind, they cannot be real. [9.26]

An illusion is not true, yet it is seen.
So it is for the mind which sees.
‘Saṃsāra must have an existent basis.
Otherwise, it would be like space.’ [9.27]

If the nonexistent were to rest on the existent,
Could it then start to function?
Your mind would be unaided
And completely solitary. [9.28]

Being free from dualistic perception,
Everyone would be an enlightened Tathāgata.
So what is achieved
By designating it mind only? [9.29]

‘How will your illusion-like understanding
Stop the defilements?
When an apparitional woman is conjured,
Desire for her arises even in her creator.’ [9.30]

That creator has not abandoned the imprints
Of the defilements in her appearance.
Thus, when he sees her,
The imprints of emptiness are weak. [9.31]

By meditating on the imprints of emptiness,
The imprints of reality will be abandoned.
By meditating it is nothing whatsoever,
That, too, will then be abandoned, [9.32]

For when one thinks, ‘It does not exist’,
There is no conception of an analysandum.
Its unreality has then lost its basis,
So how can it remain before the conceptual mind? [9.33]

When neither existence nor nonexistence
Remain before the mind,
Since there is no other category at that time,
There is a complete non-conceptual pacification. [9.34]

Just as wish granting jewels 
And wish fulfilling trees fulfil hopes,
So, too, the conquerors appear
By the power of trainees and aspiration prayers. [9.35]

For example, when the creator
Of a shrine of Garuḍa had passed away,
The shrine still pacified poisons and so on,
Long after his death. [9.36]

By holding the bodhisattva conduct,
The shrine of the Conqueror is built,
So even after the bodhisattva’s nirvāṇa,
The benefit of others continues. [9.37]

‘How could making offerings to
Someone without a mind have any result?’
Remaining in the world and passing into nirvāṇa
Were taught to be equivalent. [9.38]

Whether relative or in suchness,
According to the scriptures, there is a result,
Just as, for example, there is a result
In offering to a real Buddha. [9.39]

‘One is liberated by seeing truth,
So what is the point of seeing emptiness?’
The scriptures teach
No enlightenment without this path. [9.40]

‘The Mahāyāna is not established.’
Why are your scriptures established?
‘Because they are established for both of us.’
They were not established for you at first, [9.41]

And whatever conditions gave you confidence in them,
We have such conditions in the Mahāyāna, too.
If truth is the belief of any two others,
The Vedas and so forth would also be true. [9.42]

‘But the Mahāyāna is disputed.’
Your scriptures are also in dispute—with those of the tīrthikas,
As well as with certain other śrāvaka scriptures.
Therefore, you should abandon them. [9.43]

‘The root of the doctrine is the monk.’
It is difficult to be such a monk.
A nirvāṇa for the perceptual mind
Is also difficult to attain. [9.44]

‘One is liberated by abandoning the defilements.’
Then liberation would happen immediately,
Yet one sees the power of karma
Even though there are no defilements. [9.45]

‘That is only temporary,
For there is no direct cause—craving.’
They do have craving, though it is without defilements,
For don’t they still have fundamental delusion? [9.46]

By the condition of sensation, there is craving,
And they still have sensation.
The objectifying mind
For such people, still remains. [9.47]

Minds without emptiness
May cease, but they will arise again,
Like even settling without formations.
Therefore, meditate on emptiness. [9.48]

If you accept the words included in the sutra collection
As the Buddha’s teachings,
Why do you not accept the majority of the Mahāyāna
Which is the same as your sutras? [9.49]

If all are rejected as the Conqueror’s teachings
Due to a single point not being included, 
Why would all not be accepted
Due to a single point corresponding to your sutras? [9.50]

If the depths of these words were not fathomed
Even by someone like Mahākāśyapa,
Who should reject them
For their not being understood by you? [9.51]

For the sake of those suffering due to confusion,
One remains in saṃsāra,
But is freed from the extremes of desire and fear:
This is the result of emptiness. [9.52]

Thus, it is incorrect to so criticize
The doctrine of emptiness.
Therefore, you should meditate on emptiness
Without entertaining doubts. [9.53]

Emptiness is the antidote to the darkness
Of the obscurations of defilements and cognizables.
How can those who wish to attain omniscience
Not hurry to meditate on it? [9.54]

Something that produces suffering
Should produce fear,
But emptiness pacifies suffering,
So why should it produce fear? [9.55]

If there were something that was ‘I’,
You would be right to be afraid.
But since there is no such thing as ‘I’,
What is there to be afraid of? [9.56]

Self is not the teeth, hair or nails.
It is neither the bones nor blood.
It is neither the mucus nor phlegm,
Nor is it the lymph or pus. [9.57]

Self is neither the fat nor sweat.
Neither the lungs nor liver are the self,
Nor are any of the other inner organs.
Self is neither the excrement nor urine. [9.58]

Neither the flesh nor skin are the self,
Nor are warmth or respiration the self.
The orifices are not the self,
And none of the six consciousnesses are the self either. [9.59]

If the cognition of sound were immutable
The sound would always be perceived.
If there is no cognizable, how is that awareness?
Why call this ‘cognition?’ [9.60]

If cognition does not cognize,
It would follow that even wood is a cognition.
Without a nearby cognizable,
I would definitely call that ‘not cognizing’. [9.61]

‘It is the same thing that cognizes form.’
Then why would it not also hear at the same time?
If it is because no sound is nearby
Then there is also no cognition of it. [9.62]

How can that which has the nature
Of sound perception perceive forms?
A single person might be called father and son,
But his intrinsic nature is neither, [9.63]

Just as lightness, activity and darkness
Are neither father nor son.
Nobody has ever seen
Visual perception with the nature of sound perception. [9.64]

‘Like an actor, it assumes different characteristics.’
If it sees, it is not immutable.
‘It just appears differently.’
Such singularity is something unprecedented. [9.65]

‘Its different characteristics are not real.’
Then describe its true nature.
‘It is cognition itself.’
Then it would follow that all beings are one. [9.66]

Sentient and insentient would also be one
Because they are equal merely in being existent.
If the instances are delusions,
What common basis could they have? [9.67]

Something insentient is not the self,
Because of its very insentience, like a vase.
Because of its possession of a mind,
If it then cognizes, it follows that its non-cognition has been eliminated. [9.68]

‘The self has not changed.’
Then how did it become sentient?
Thus, being non-cognizing and free from activity,
Space would also be such a ‘self’. [9.69]

‘If the self does not exist,
A connection between actions and results is illogical.
After performing an action, it is gone,
So, for whom could there be karma?’ [9.70]

It is established for both of us
That action and result have different bases
And that a self does not have any role in this.
So, is your objection here not pointless? [9.71]

‘The causal agent is the recipient of its result.’
No one ever sees this happen.
It is just in dependence upon a single stream of being
That the so-called ‘agent’ and ‘experiencer’ are taught. [9.72]

The past and future minds are not the self,
Because they do not exist.
If the arising mind were the self,
Then when it ceased, there would be no more self. [9.73]

For example, if you split apart
The trunks of banana trees, nothing is found.
Similarly, if you search for it thoroughly,
You will find the self to be no more real than this. [9.74]

‘If sentient beings do not exist,
For whom should we have compassion?’
Compassion is for those who appear out of confusion:
They are accepted for the sake of the results. [9.75]

‘If there are no sentient beings, who gets the results?’
This is true but, nevertheless, they are accepted out of confusion.
For the sake of fully pacifying suffering,
One should not oppose the delusion of these results. [9.76]

Confusion about the self increases
Pride, the cause of suffering.
‘There is no way to resolve this [contradiction].’
The meditation on non-self is supreme. [9.77]

The body is neither the feet nor calves,
Nor is it the thighs or waist,
Abdomen or back,
Chest or shoulders, [9.78]

Ribs or hands,
Joints or cavities,
Internal organs,
Head or neck.
What is this body then? [9.79]

If this body is present as a whole
Among its individual parts
Then part of it consists in each part,
But where is the thing itself? [9.80]

If the body consists of a complete whole
In the hands and so forth,
There would be as many bodies
As there are hands and so forth. [9.81]

If the body is neither inside nor out,
Neither within the hands and so forth,
Nor apart from the hands and so forth,
How does it exist at all? [9.82]

Therefore, out of confusion, we think there is a body
Where there is none.
It is like thinking a heap of stones is a person
By some particularity of its arrangement. [9.83]

While the conditions are assembled,
The body will continue to appear as a person.
So, while the hands and so forth exist,
A body continues to appear. [9.84]

Similarly, what more is a hand
Than a collection of fingers?
These, too, are collections of joints,
Which have their own distinct parts. [9.85]

Even parts have distinct particles,
And those particles have distinct areas.
Even these distinct areas are not without parts;
They are like space. Therefore, not even particles exist. [9.86]

Accordingly, who could make this analysis,
And still have attachment to dreamlike forms?
When there is no existent body,
What is a man and what is a woman? [9.87]

If suffering exists in reality,
Why does it not prevent joyfulness?
If there is happiness, why are those afflicted by pain and so forth
Not made joyful by sweetness and so forth? [9.88]

‘It is not experienced because
It is overridden by the stronger force.’
If something is not experienced,
How can it be a sensation? [9.89]

‘The suffering exists as a subtlety
When its coarseness has been removed.’
If this implies it is something other than suffering,
Then, whatever that is, that is what this ‘subtlety’ is. [9.90]

If suffering cannot occur
Due to the arising of its contrary condition,
Shouldn’t such suffering be considered
Merely the attachment to a concept? [9.91]

Because of this, meditate upon
This analysis as the antidote.
The meditation arising from
This field of examination is the food of yogins. [9.92]

If an intermediary connects sense organ and object,
Where do they make contact?
If there is no intermediary, they are unified.
So, what has contact with what? [9.93]

Particles do not impose upon other particles,
For they are identical in having no capacity.
Without imposition, they cannot combine.
Without combining, they cannot make contact. [9.94]

‘They make contact despite being partless.’
How does this make any sense?
Making contact with something partless:
When you see it, will you show me? [9.95]

It is illogical to make contact with
Consciousness, which is bodiless,
And likewise for anything composite, because it is nonexistent,
As was analysed previously. [9.96]

If there is no real contact,
What are these sensations arising from?
Why go to all this trouble?
What could be harmed by what? [9.97]

If the one who senses
And the sensations themselves are nonexistent,
Once this has been seen,
How could craving not be dispelled? [9.98]

Even what is seen or touched
Is itself dreamlike and illusion-like.
Sensations are not perceived by mind,
Because they arise simultaneously with it. [9.99]

Although something from before may be remembered after,
That is not the experiencing of it.
A sensation cannot experience itself,
Nor does anything else experience it. [9.100]

There is nothing existent that experiences sensations.
Therefore, there are no sensations.
Therefore, what could ever harm
This selfless composite? [9.101]

Mind does not dwell in the senses,
Nor in forms, etc., nor somewhere between these.
Mind is neither the inner nor outer,
Nor is it found anywhere else. [9.102]

It is neither within the body, nor apart from it.
It is not combined, nor is it something distinct.
Because such a thing does not even slightly exist,
Sentient beings are by nature nirvāṇa. [9.103]

If the cognition exists before the cognizable,
What does it arise from?
If cognition is co-emergent with the cognizable,
What does it arise from? [9.104]

If it exists after the cognizable,
In that moment, what does it arise from?
Accordingly, all dharmas
Should be understood as non-arising. [9.105]

‘In that case, there is not really any relative arising,
So how can there be two truths?
If the relative exists for the Buddha due to others,
How can sentient beings transcend suffering?’ [9.106]

The relative is just the discrimination of those other minds.
It is not the Buddha’s perspective.
If [the effect] is ascertained as arising after [the cause], it exists as relative.
If not, it does not have even relative existence. [9.107]

The understanding and its analysandum
Are mutually dependent.
All analysis is expressed
In dependence upon accord with consensus. [9.108]

If at that time there were an analyst
Analysing the analysis
Then there would be an infinite regress
Because that analysis, too, would have to be analyzed. [9.109]

However, when the analysandum has been analyzed
Then that analysis has no basis.
Because it has no basis, it is non-arising.
This is also called ‘nirvāṇa’. [9.110]

In that case, the existence of this pair
Is a reality that is extremely difficult to maintain.
If objects are established from the sense powers,
What supports the existence of the cognition? [9.111]

‘Cognition is established from the cognizable.’
Then what supports the existence of the cognizable?
If they are in mutual dependence,
Then neither one exists. [9.112]

If there is no father without a son,
Where does the son come from?
There is no father without a son.
Accordingly, neither of them exist independently. [9.113]

‘When a sprout comes from a seed,
We acknowledge the existence of the seed.
Since cognition arises from a cognizable,
Why do you not acknowledge the cognizable’s existence?’ [9.114]

When it is acknowledged the seed exists,
That cognition is independent of the sprout,
But what independently acknowledges the cognition
Comprehending the cognizable? [9.115]

Worldly ones directly see
Everything temporal has causes.
Differences such as in the segments of a lotus
Are produced by different causes. [9.116]

‘What creates the different causes?’
They come from previous different causes.
‘Why is a cause able to produce its effect?’
It comes from the power of a previous cause. [9.117]

If Īśvara is the cause of beings,
Please explain what the temporal Īśvara is.
If you say, ‘the elements’, that is fine,
But why trouble yourself over a mere name? [9.118]

Furthermore, since the earth and so forth are multiple,
Impermanent, inanimate, not deities,
Suitable to be trodden on and impure,
They are not Īśvara. [9.119]

Space is not Īśvara because it is inanimate.
He is not the self because that was refuted previously.
Since it is inconceivable to describe
A creator who is inconceivable, what would be the point of trying? [9.120]

What could he want to create anyway?
Do you not claim that the self, the earth, etc.
And even Īśvara’s own nature are sempiternal?
Cognitions arise from cognizables, [9.121]

And beginningless happiness and suffering come from actions.
So, what is it you say he has created?
If the cause has no beginning,
How can the effect begin? [9.122]

How could his creations not be sempiternal,
When he depends upon nothing external?
If there is nothing that was not created by him,
What could he depend upon? [9.123]

If he were dependent, the occurrence conditions
Would be the cause, not Īśvara.
When assembled, he is powerless not to create;
When absent, he is powerless to create. [9.124]

If Īśvara creates without wanting to,
He is affected by an external power.
If he creates only when he wishes, the effect depends on his wishes.
How then is he ‘The Almighty’ [Īśvara]? [9.125]

For those who assert sempiternal particles,
The refutation was completed previously.
The position of the Sāṃkhyas is that
The cause of beings is a permanent, primal substance. [9.126]

Its qualities are ‘purity’, ‘activity’ and ‘darkness’.
While they remain in equilibrium,
They are called the ‘primal substance’.
Manifestations are said to be their disequilibrium. [9.127]

A triple nature that is also singular
Is illogical. There is no such thing.
The three qualities also do not exist
Because each of them would also have three parts. [9.128]

Without the qualities, the existence of sound
And so forth also becomes extremely implausible.
Nor can the insentient, such as cloth,
Contain pleasure and so forth. [9.129]

‘They are caused by the substantial bare elements.’
Wasn’t the analysis of such substances already completed?
Also, the pleasure and so forth in the primal substance were your causes, not the bare elements.
Cloth and so forth do not arise from pleasure and so forth. [9.130]

Rather, pleasure and so forth arise from cloth and so forth.
Apart from this, there is no pleasure and so forth.
Sempiternal pleasure and so forth
Have never been perceived. [9.131]

If pleasure and so forth are essentially manifest,
Why are they not experienced?
‘They become subtle.’
How can something gross also be subtle? [9.132]

‘It becomes subtle by the elimination of the gross.’
Then the gross and subtle states are both impermanent.
In this way, why not accept
That all such things are impermanent? [9.133]

If the gross state is nothing other than pleasure,
It is evident that pleasure is impermanent.
‘Whatever does not already exist
Cannot arise because of its not existing.’ [9.134]

Although you deny that manifestations can arise
From their nonexistence, you also assert it.
If effects abide in their causes,
To eat food would be to eat excrement. [9.135]

For the money you spent on cotton, you should have instead
Bought cotton seeds and worn them.
‘The worldly fail to see it due to delusion.’
Yet, someone who knows the reality is in the same predicament, [9.136]

And since that knowledge of reality exists even for
The worldly, why do they not see it?
‘The worldly do not have valid cognition.’
Then their seeing of the manifestations would also be untrue. [9.137]

‘If valid cognition is deluded,
Are your analyses not false?
If reality is emptiness,
Meditation for the sake of it is unreasonable.’ [9.138]

With no connection to an object of examination
There is no grasping of its nonexistence.
Therefore, whatever the false object may be,
Its nonexistence is clearly false. [9.139]

When the son dies in a dream,
The discrimination that ‘he does not exist’
Counters the discrimination that he exists,
Even though it is false. [9.140]

Therefore, on this analysis,
Nothing exists without a cause,
Nor abides in its conditions,
Whether individually or combined. [9.141]

Nor does it come from other,
Nor stay, nor go.
This is what deluded ones take as real,
But how is it different from an illusion? [9.142]

Whatever manifests by illusion
And whatever manifests by causes,
Examine from where it could come
And to where it could go. [9.143]

Whatever it is, it is seen only in relation to something else.
Otherwise, it is not seen.
It is fabricated, like a reflection.
How can there be reality in that? [9.144]

For something that already exists,
What cause does it require?
And if it does not exist,
What cause does it require? [9.145]

Even a billion causes
Cannot alter nonexistence.
How can a state of nonexistence be existent,
Or become existent? [9.146]

If its existence is impossible during its nonexistence,
When could it ever become something existent?
While its existence has not yet begun,
Its nonexistence has not yet been lost. [9.147]

If its nonexistence has not been lost,
It is impossible for it to exist.
Nor can the existent become nonexistent,
Because it would follow that it would have two intrinsic natures. [9.148]

In this way, there is no cessation.
Nor is there any existence. 
Because of this, all these beings
Are forever neither arising nor ceasing. [9.149]

Dreamlike beings,
When analysed, are like banana trees.
In suchness, there is no distinction
Between nirvāṇa and non-nirvāṇa. [9.150]

What is there to gain and what is there to lose
Of things which are, in this way, empty?
Who exists to respect me,
Or to despise me? [9.151]

Where do happiness and suffering come from?
What is there to be joyful or miserable about?
When I try to find reality itself,
Who has craving and what is there to crave? [9.152]

When analysed, what lives in this world
And what can die in it?
What can arise and what has ever arisen?
What friends or relatives are there? [9.153]

All is like space.
May we come to fully understand this.
For those who want happiness,
The causes of conflict and excitement [9.154]

Create intense disturbance and hysteria.
We are tormenting, fighting and arguing with one another,
Cutting and stabbing one another.
By such nonvirtues, we endure great difficulties. [9.155]

Having enjoyed so much happiness,
In happy rebirths again and again,
After death, it ends, and one suffers,
Falling into torment for a long time. [9.156]

Within conditioned existence, there are many precipices,
For there is no truth in it.
Where there is conditioned existence, there is no reality,
For they are incompatible. [9.157]

There is no way to truly exemplify
This unending ocean of unbearable suffering.
It is where we lack strength.
It is where life is short. [9.158]

It is where we are worn out, striving to live and get by,
Where we are exhausted by hunger and sickness,
Where we sleep and where we cause harm,
And where we meaninglessly associate with the childish and with friends. [9.159]

So life swiftly passes by without any meaning,
And a remedy is extremely difficult to find.
How can we find a way
To dispel habitual distraction? [9.160]

It is where demons are striving to cast us
Into the great lower realms.
It is where overcoming doubts is hard
Among its many mistaken paths. [9.161]

An opportunity like this will be difficult to find again,
And the presence of Buddhas will be extremely difficult to find.
It is difficult to escape the river of defilements.
Alas! The suffering just goes on and on. [9.162]

Although the sufferings are intense,
Some cannot recognize their own misery.
Alas! It is only right to feel pity
For those who dwell in the rivers of suffering. [9.163]

This is like, for example, bathing again and again,
And then stepping into a fire again and again,
Proclaiming one’s happiness,
While being in immense pain. [9.164]

So, carrying on as if
There were no old age or death,
They are first subjected to death
And then fall into the unbearable lower realms. [9.165]

When will I be able to pacify
These unbearable fires of suffering
With a rain of accumulated happiness
Falling from clouds of stored up merit? [9.166]

Having fostered the non-conceptual
And devotedly accumulated merits,
When will I show emptiness
To those lost in conceptualization? [9.167]

Chapter 10: Dedication

By whatever virtue there is
In my undertaking
To enter the bodhisattva conduct,
May all beings enter the bodhisattva conduct. [10.1]

By my merit,
May all those in all directions
Afflicted with physical and mental suffering
Attain oceans of happiness and joy. [10.2]

As long as they remain in saṃsāra,
May their happiness never fail.
May beings attain the uninterrupted
Happiness of a bodhisattva. [10.3]

In however many hells
There may be in existence,
May all those living creatures
Have the bliss and joy of Sukhāvatī. [10.4]

May those tormented by the cold find warmth,
And may boundless waters pour
From the clouds of bodhisattvas,
Cooling those tormented by the heat. [10.5]

May the forests of razors
Become divine groves.
May the trees of Śālmari
Grow into wish fulfilling trees. [10.6]

May the realms of hell become places of joy,
Covered with vast pools, fragrant with lotus flowers,
With calls of wild ducks, geese and swans
Resounding gently in the air. [10.7]

May its burning pyres become heaps of jewels.
May its molten earth become a clear, crystal floor.
May its crushing mountains become
Celestial palaces of worship, filled with Buddhas. [10.8]

May its showers of embers, burning rocks and fiery razors
From now on be a rain of flowers.
May the conflict of armed violence
From now on be a casting of flowers. [10.9]

May those submerged in the torrents of hell,
Their flesh completely incinerated from their lily-white bones,
Attain, from this virtue, the bodies of gods,
And dwell among goddesses in gentle, divine rivers. [10.10]

‘Why are the servants of the Lord of Death and his dreadful crows and vultures suddenly afraid?
Whose power clears away the enveloping darkness, bringing joy and happiness?’
When they look up, may they see the blazing form of Vajrapāṇi in the sky,
And the power of their intense joy clearing away all negativities, may they go to join him. [10.11]

Seeing the glittering fires of hell
Extinguished by rains of flowers mixed with scented water,
May they wonder what could have brought such happiness,
And may these denizens of hell see Padmapāṇi himself. [10.12]

‘Friends, come here quickly. Don’t be afraid.
He forcefully dispels all our suffering and brings the power of joy!
A protector of all beings, who has generated bodhicitta and kindness,
A blazing youth with hair in knotted locks delivers us from these horrors. [10.13]

‘See one hundred gods offer their crowns at his lotus feet.
A rain of flowers falls upon his head, his eyes moist with compassion.
Thousands of goddesses sing his praises atop magnificent pavilions.’
Upon seeing Mañjughoṣa, may the denizens of hell cry out in joy. [10.14]

By the roots of my virtue, may the denizens of hell,
Seeing the cooling, fragrant rains of happiness fall
From the stainless clouds of the bodhisattvas such as Samantabhadra,
Be filled with joy. [10.15]

May animals be freed
From the horrors of preying upon one another.
May ghosts have happiness
Like that of the Northern Continent. [10.16]

May their hunger be sated,
And may they always be bathed and refreshed
By streams of milk
Flowing from the hands of Avalokiteśvara. [10.17]

May the blind see
And may the deaf hear.
May mothers give birth without any pain
Like Māyādevī herself. [10.18]

May the naked find clothes,
The hungry find food,
And the thirsty find water
And delightful, refreshing drinks. [10.19]

May the poor acquire wealth.
May the unhappy and miserable find joy.
May the distressed be placated,
And may they have confidence and stability. [10.20]

Wherever sentient beings are unwell,
May their sicknesses quickly disappear.
May the diseases affecting every living creature
Cease and never occur again. [10.21]

May those who are afraid be without fear.
May those who are bound be freed.
May the weak find strength
And may their minds be calmed. [10.22]

May all those travelling abroad
Be happy wherever they may go and,
For whatever purpose they are travelling,
May they achieve it without any difficulties. [10.23]

May all those aboard boats and ships
Achieve whatever they set out to do and,
Having happily returned to their own shores,
May they be reunited with their loved ones. [10.24]

May those who have lost their paths
Encounter fellow travellers,
And proceed to their destinations with ease,
Unmolested by bandits, wild animals and so on. [10.25]

May those who are lost and alone in wildernesses,
Children and the elderly without any protector,
Those who are unconscious, mentally disturbed or insane,
Be protected by the gods. [10.26]

May they never lack the eight freedoms.
May they have faith, wisdom and kindness,
Eat appropriate food, have good conduct,
And remember their former rebirths. [10.27]

May they have inexhaustible wealth
Like that of the bodhisattva Gaganagañja.
May they be able to do as they please,
Without conflict or violence. [10.28]

May beings with little splendour
Come to have magnificent glory.
May those who are emaciated or ugly
Come to have radiant beauty. [10.29]

May women everywhere in the world
Be reborn as men.
May the lowly achieve highness
And crush any arrogance. [10.30]

By my merit,
May all sentient beings without exception
Abandon all nonvirtue
And always practise virtue. [10.31]

May they never be separated from bodhicitta
And may they practise the bodhisattva conduct.
May they be supported by the Buddhas
And abandon the actions of Māra. [10.32]

May all sentient beings
Have immeasurably long lives.
May they live in constant happiness
Where the word ‘death’ is never even heard. [10.33]

Everywhere may there be
Gardens of wish fulfilling trees
Filled with Buddhas and bodhisattvas
And resounding with the delightful sounds of dharma. [10.34]

Everywhere may the land be
Without stones, etc.,
Smooth like the palm of a hand,
And even like a lapis lazuli. [10.35]

May many mandala circles
Of many bodhisattvas
Adorn the face of the earth,
Beautifying it with their natural radiance. [10.36]

May all embodied beings
Continuously hear sounds of dharma
From all the birds, trees,
Rays of light and even space itself. [10.37]

May they always meet with the Buddhas and their sons,
And with limitless clouds of offerings
May they pay homage 
To the supreme ones among all beings. [10.38]

May the gods bring timely rains,
And may crops be abundant.
May kings reign in accord with dharma,
And may the people prosper. [10.39]

May medicines be effective
And may mantra recitation bring accomplishment.
May ḍākinīs and ogres
Have compassionate minds. [10.40]

May no sentient being ever
Be in pain, practise nonvirtue,
Be afraid or abused.
May they never be unhappy. [10.41]

In the monasteries, may reading
And recitation flourish and endure.
May the saṅgha always be harmonious,
And may they be firmly established. [10.42]

May monks who wish to train
Find places of solitude and,
Abandoning all distraction,
May they meditate with peace of mind. [10.43]

May nuns have material support,
And may they be free from conflict or danger.
May all monastics
Never let their moral conduct be damaged. [10.44]

May the immoral tire of their ways
And may their nonvirtues come to an end.
Attaining a happy rebirth,
May their conduct never be impaired. [10.45]

May the learned be respected
And find the support they need.
May their minds be pure
And may they be renowned in every direction. [10.46]

In future lives may nobody experience suffering,
And may whatever they do be without difficulties.
May they quickly achieve buddhahood
With a physical form surpassing that of a god. [10.47]

May all sentient beings
Make many offerings to all the Buddhas.
May their happiness
Be the inconceivable bliss of a Buddha. [10.48]

May the wishes of bodhisattvas
For the benefit of beings be accomplished,
And may all beings have everything
The Protectors wish for them. [10.49]

Similarly, may all śrāvakas
And pratyekabuddhas have happiness. [10.50]

Until I have reached the ‘Joyous’ bhūmi,
Through the kindness of Mañjughoṣa,
May I remember my previous lives
And attain ordination. [10.51]

May I live with simple food
And have simple needs,
And throughout all my lives
May I find perfect solitude. [10.52]

If I ever wish to look upon him
Or ask him the slightest question,
May I see the protector
Mañjughoṣa himself, without any hindrance. [10.53]

In order to accomplish the benefit
Of all sentient beings, as limitless as space,
May my conduct
Be like that of Mañjughoṣa. [10.54]

As long as space endures
There will be living beings.
For that long may I remain
To dispel their suffering. [10.55]

However they may be suffering,
May all their suffering ripen in me.
May the bodhisattva saṅgha
Bring happiness to the world. [10.56]

May the teachings, which are the only medicine 
For suffering and which are the source of all happiness,
Be honoured and respected,
And may they long remain. [10.57]

I prostrate to Mañjughoṣa,
By whose kindness my mind turned to virtue,
And I prostrate to my spiritual masters,
By whose kindness I matured. [10.58]
