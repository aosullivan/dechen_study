>>> I bow down to the Lion of the Śākyas.
>>> Chapter 1: In Praise of Bodhicitta
>>> To the Sugatas, the dharmakāya they have mastered, and their sons, 
>>> And to all those worthy of prostration, I respectfully prostrate.
>>> To enter the vow of the Sugatas’ sons,
>>> In accord with the tradition, I will now briefly explain.
>>> Nothing said here has not been said before,
>>> And I have neither eloquence nor erudition,
>>> So, I do not expect this to benefit others.
>>> I composed it only to develop my own understanding.
>>> Because of developing virtue like this, 
>>> The power of my faith will increase for a little while.
>>> But if others, similar in fortune to me, 
>>> Should see it, that is also of benefit.
>>> The purpose of the commitment to compose: having made the promise, the composition of the śāstra is sure to be completed because holy beings do not abandon whatever promises they have made. 
>>> To the Sugatas, the dharmakāya they have mastered, and their sons, 
>>> And to all those worthy of prostration, I respectfully prostrate.
>>> •	Abandonment is ‘irreversible’ because, since the abandonment is final, there is knowledge of non-arising and knowledge of exhaustion.
>>> To enter the vow of the Sugatas’ sons,
>>> 1.	The individuals who undertake the vow: the Sugatas’ sons are bodhisattvas in whose minds the vow exists.
>>> … I will now briefly explain.
>>> Nothing said here has not been said before,
>>> And I have neither eloquence nor erudition.
>>> So I do not expect this to benefit others.
>>> Response: it is not expected to benefit others. In which case, is the benefit of others neglected? No, because there is no possibility of it benefitting others. Why not? Because, regarding the meaning, nothing said here has not been said before, i.e. it will not create any understanding that was previously lacking and because, regarding the words, they are neither eloquent nor erudite, i.e. they will not create any understanding in the manner of beautiful poetics, such as the Condensed Succession of Lives by Virācārya [Aśvaghoṣa].
>>> I composed it only to develop my own understanding.
>>> Because of developing virtue like this, 
>>> The power of my faith will increase for a little while.
>>> Why compose this? Because it will increase the power of faith. What circumstances bring that about? A virtuous act such as composing this śāstra will bring it about, as well as other similar virtues, such as hearing it. How long will that last? A little while. What causes it? The development of virtue, i.e. the habituation of one’s mind to virtue. In that case, is the benefit of others disregarded? Will the bodhisattva conduct be impaired? When their benefit is not possible, there is no work to be done for the benefit of others, but when it is possible to do something, the benefit of others should not be disregarded.
>>> But if others, similar in fortune to me, 
>>> Should see it, that is also of benefit.
>>> There is benefit for others similar in fortune to the author and, implicitly, for those who are less fortunate. Although, according to the author, the explanation is poor, it is based upon the words of holy beings. ‘Also’ means in addition to the benefit for the author.
>>> 1.	The explanandum is ‘the entrance to the vow of the Sugatas’ sons’ [v1c].
>>> 1.	To become a suitable vessel in one’s stream of being through eliminating the karmic obscuration of greed, one makes offerings to the Three Jewels.
>>> 3.	To become a suitable vessel in one’s stream of being through eliminating the karmic obscurations of nonvirtuous actions of body, speech and mind, one confesses faults. Of these three, since confession is the principal one, the overall chapter is called ‘Confession of faults’ [chapter 2].
>>> 3.2. The main part: Having established the perfectly purified basis, one generates the bodhicitta of aspiration, wishing to actually realize the suchness of all dharmas and to benefit beings through attaining the kāya of complete omniscience. After the preliminary of the threefold-aspiration mind,7 one then grasps the hook of the vow. [255]
>>> Part 4, the cooperating condition—subsequently accomplishing the training: the general cause of accomplishing the training is ‘Concern’ [chapter 4]. The specific trainings are the six perfections. Among these, giving does not have a separate chapter solely on its practice but is taught throughout the text. Moral conduct is taught in the chapter on ‘Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension’, [chapter 5] because that is the cause of moral conduct not declining. ‘Patience’ and the rest of the six perfections are directly taught in the next four eponymous chapters.
>>> Nor from mindfulness and clear comprehension,
>>> 3.	Seeing the nature of the antidotes: the path of unified calm abiding and insight meditation
>>> By whatever virtue there is
>>> In my undertaking 
>>> To enter the bodhisattva conduct…

>>> In Praise of Bodhicitta (2)
>>> It is extremely difficult to acquire the freedoms and endowments
>>> Which make this human birth meaningful.
>>> If I fail to benefit from it now,
>>> How will I get a chance like this again?
>>> 1.	Their nature 
>>> 1. Their nature
>>> It is said to be ‘extremely difficult’ because it is even more difficult than for a turtle to put his neck through the centre of a wooden yoke afloat on an ocean.
>>> Whilst it may be difficult to acquire, since it is only of slight benefit, why acquire it? A ‘human birth’ is ‘meaningful’ because it is the basis for attaining higher rebirths and definitive goodness. 
>>> Just as lightning flashes for an instant 
>>> Through the dark, black clouds of the night,
>>> Likewise, only rarely, merit and intelligence arise 
>>> Fleetingly in the world through the power of the Buddhas.
>>> If one wonders how the difficulty of acquiring human birth is being exemplified here, the example is: ‘night’ means being without the appearance of the sun, ‘dark and black’ means being without the appearance of the moon, ‘clouds’ means having little chance of any appearances and ‘just as lightning flashes for an instant’ means appearing nevertheless, despite those factors. Also, ‘through the power of the Buddhas’ is the condition of the attitudes, ‘merit and intelligence’ is the nature, ‘only rarely’ means arising only very occasionally and ‘arise fleetingly’ means not remaining for very long.
>>> In Praise of Bodhicitta (3)
>>> 3.	It has the power to benefit others
>>> In this way, virtue is constantly weak and feeble,
>>> And the extremely great power of nonvirtue is unbearable.
>>> The first line indicates the weakness of the power of the antidote. ‘The extremely great power of nonvirtue’ indicates the great power of that which is to be abandoned. ‘Unbearable’ indicates the result of this—suffering. One’s nonvirtues are not dominated by virtues; rather, one’s virtues are dominated by nonvirtues. 
>>> What virtue, if not perfect bodhicitta,
>>> Could possibly overcome it?
>>> The mighty sages, who have known it for many aeons,
>>> Have seen that only bodhicitta has this power.
>>> 3. It has the power to benefit others
>>> With bodhicitta, limitless multitudes
>>> Will easily attain the supreme bliss.
>>> When this intention arises in their mind, limitless sentient beings will easily attain the supreme bliss of great enlightenment. Why is this accomplishment so easy, when one must practise with difficulty for three inconceivable aeons? Because bodhisattvas give rise to a mind which takes joy in undertaking difficulties for the benefit of others, because their suffering is accompanied by the result, and because, compared to the limitless sufferings of saṃsāra, the difficulties are very slight.
>>> Those wishing to end the many sufferings of conditioned existence,
>>> Those wishing to dispel the unhappiness of beings,
>>> And those wishing for many happinesses, 
>>> Should never abandon this bodhicitta.
>>> Since the happiness of the śrāvakas and happiness within conditioned existence may arise without the generation of bodhicitta, if they do arise with it, is it not illogical to say they are results of bodhicitta? They are not contrary to it and although they are not part of its nature, results will occur even while generating bodhicitta as mere by-products. Since these are temporarily connected with it, they are presented as the results of bodhicitta. So even those who wish to train in the śrāvaka bhūmis should practise the training of the perfection of wisdom.
>>> The very instant bodhicitta arises 
>>> In someone tormented in the prison of saṃsāra,
>>> They will be called an ‘heir of the Sugatas’,
>>> And be praised by gods and men.
>>> When bodhicitta arises, a new name is received: one is called an ‘heir of the Sugatas’, meaning that one is worthy of the praises of worldly gods and men. Who receives this? All beings who are tormented in the prison of saṃsāra. When do they receive it? The very instant that they generate bodhicitta.
>>> 2.	It is difficult to find but extremely powerful, like a wish fulfilling jewel
>>> 5.	It consumes the inevitable results of nonvirtuous actions, like the fire at the end of time
>>> Like a supreme alchemical elixir,
>>> Having imbibed it, the impure body is transformed
>>> Into the priceless jewel of the kāya of a conqueror.
>>> So, firmly take hold of what is called ‘bodhicitta’.
>>> The impure body is transformed. Into what? Into the priceless jewel of the kāya of a conqueror. What transforms it? The ‘taking hold’, i.e. taking hold of the generation of bodhicitta. How is that exemplified? [261] It is like the transformation of base metals into gold by an alchemical elixir. Alternatively, ‘take hold’ may refer to [the transformation of] the body itself.
>>> 2. It is difficult to find but extremely powerful, like a wish fulfilling jewel
>>> If the only guides of beings have, with unfettered minds,
>>> Seen its value in consummate examination,
>>> Those of us who want to be free from wandering
>>> Should firmly grasp the precious bodhicitta.
>>> Who grasps firmly this precious bodhicitta? Those who wish to be free from the saṃsāric state of wandering. Why do they grasp it? Because its value has been seen in consummate examination. Whose examination? The ‘guides of beings’, i.e. the Sugatas, who have examined it with their enlightened minds.
>>> All other virtues are, like a plantain tree,
>>> Exhausted after they produce their fruit,
>>> But the perennial tree of bodhicitta
>>> Grows with an inexhaustible supply.
>>> Like facing great terrors accompanied by a warrior,
>>> Even those who have committed the extremely evil acts
>>> Will instantly be freed by relying on it.
>>> Why then would conscientious people not rely on this?
>>> One will be freed from the intense suffering that results from the extremely evil inexpiable acts after just a moment of experiencing it. Although the acts are not purified, temporarily the resultant ripening of the sufferings does not occur, until finally they are discarded. For whom? For whomever relies upon bodhicitta. In what way? Like passing great terrors guarded by a warrior, until the final destination is reached, temporarily one will not be harmed.
>>> 5. It consumes the inevitable results of nonvirtuous actions, like the fire at the end of time
>>> Like the fire at the end of time, great evils
>>> Are totally consumed by it.
>>> Bodhicitta consumes the great inexpiable evil deeds and they are gone forever. How long does it take? An instant. What is it like? It is like the fire at the end of time, i.e. the world-destroying fire at the end of the aeon.
>>> Its benefits are limitless,
>>> As Lord Maitreya explained to Sudhana.
>>> Where are the limitless benefits of bodhicitta explained? In the Āryabuddhavataṃsaka Sutra. By whom are they explained? By Lord Maitreya. [262] To whom are they explained? They are explained to Sudhana, as follows. The merchant’s son Sudhana, having generated bodhicitta before the Bhagavān Mañjughoṣa and having received instructions from many spiritual teachers, finally sought out the Jina Maitreya in the ‘Palace of Vairocana Adorned with Ornaments’ on the shores of a great lake. Maitreya received him, saying,
>>> And so on. Following this praise, Sudhana, the merchant’s son, requested, ‘I have generated bodhicitta but I pray you teach me how to train with diligence.’
>>> Maitreya responded, ‘Son of noble family, bodhicitta is like the seed of all the Buddha’s teachings. Since it makes virtuous dharmas grow in all beings, it is like a field. Since it is the support of the entire world, it is like the earth. Since one is protected by all the bodhisattvas, it is like a father. Since it delivers from all poverty, it is like Vaiśravaṇa. Since it perfectly establishes all benefits, it is like a wish fulfilling gem. Since it defeats the enemy defilements, it is like a lance. Since it envelops the undisciplined mind, it is like clothing. Since it severs the head of the defilements, it is like a sword. [263] Since it protects from all hostility, it is like a weapon. Since it captures those in the river of saṃsāra, it is like a fishing hook. Since it scatters the layer of dust of the defilements, it is like the mandala of wind. Since it collects all the conduct and aspirations of the bodhisattvas, it is like synopsis. Since it is worshipped by the worlds of humans, demigods and gods, it is like a stupa. Son of noble family, bodhicitta possesses these qualities, as well as a myriad of other qualities.’ 
>>> When summarized, bodhicitta
>>> Should be known as having two types:
>>> Bodhicitta of aspiration
>>> And bodhicitta of application.
>>> Like understanding the difference 
>>> Between wishing to go and going,
>>> So the wise should understand the difference
>>> Between these two, respectively.
>>> Some say that aspiration, as the wish to go, is generating the mind which arises from symbols [or words] because one merely takes motivation as one’s object in order to have realization of the path. Application, as the actual going, is generating the mind of the attainment of the ultimate dharmata because one takes actual enlightenment as one’s object by directly entering the uncorrupted path of seeing the truth. However, this is not the opinion of the Ācārya [Śāntideva] because he explains in the Śikṣā-samuccaya that ordinary individuals also train in application [bodhicitta] and hence the dharmata is attained only by receiving teachings on the practices of application bodhicitta.4 [264]
>>> For those wandering in saṃsāra,
>>> Great results arise from aspiration bodhicitta,
>>> But a ceaseless stream of merits does not arise
>>> As it does for application bodhicitta.
>>> For whoever embraces 
>>> This incontrovertible intent to liberate
>>> Limitless realms of beings,
>>> By the perfect adoption of that intent,
>>> From the moment of embracing it, even when asleep
>>> Or distracted, a force of merit
>>> As vast as space
>>> Arises in an uninterrupted stream.
>>> The one who adopts this intent, from the moment it is embraced, creates a force of merit equal to the sky. What does it mean to ‘adopt’ the intent? It means that the intent is ‘irreversible’, i.e. one does not allow the commitment to practise the path to diminish. What is the purpose of not allowing the commitment to practise the path to diminish? It is to completely liberate the limitless realms of sentient beings. Therefore, through adopting the generation of the mind which thinks, ‘I will not allow the conduct which will liberate sentient beings to diminish’, merit increases. Does it increase only intermittently? No, it is constant, without interruption. When does the cause to fulfil the intent occur? Although the cause is not present when one is sleeping or distracted, it nevertheless arises by the power of adopting the commitment. For example, this is like the continuity of merit that arises for someone who adopts renunciation, even when sleeping or distracted. Regarding this distraction, however, if someone is generating bodhicitta but, out of distraction from training, decides to stop practising, it is not logical that merit still increases.
>>> The Tathāgata himself taught
>>> These benefits along with their reasons
>>> In the Sutra Requested by Subahu
>>> For the sake of those inclined to lesser paths.
>>> These benefits were taught by the Tathāgata himself. [266] In what sutra? In the Sutra Requested by Subahu. For what purpose? For the sake of benefitting sentient beings inclined towards lesser paths, i.e. they were taught for the benefit of the uncertain Mahāyāna family. Are they merely described? No, their reasons are also explained, i.e. the benefits are demonstrated with the reasons for them, as explained in the next section.
>>> Even if one wishes to dispel merely
>>> The head pains of beings,
>>> The possession of that beneficial intention
>>> Is endowed with boundless merit.
>>> What can one say then of the wish to dispel
>>> The endless unhappiness of each sentient being,
>>> Wishing to establish every single one of them
>>> In limitless qualities?
>>> If even the intention to dispel pains in the head has such benefit, what can one say of the wish to dispel the endless suffering of all the limitless sentient beings and to establish every one of them in limitless happiness?
>>> Do even our father or mothers
>>> Ever have such a benevolent wish?
>>> Do even the gods, the rishis, 
>>> Or even Brahmā harbour such benevolence? 
>>> Those beings never before, 
>>> Even in their dreams,
>>> Had an intention like this, even for their own sake.
>>> How could it arise then for the sake of others?
>>> The intention to benefit others did not arise
>>> For sentient beings even for their own sake.
>>> The arising of this highest treasure of the mind
>>> Is an unprecedented wonder.
>>> It is the cause of joy in all wandering beings.
>>> It is the elixir remedying the suffering of sentient beings.
>>> How can the merit of this treasure of mind
>>> Even begin to be measured or quantified?
>>> If the mere intention to help others
>>> Is better than making offerings to the Buddhas,
>>> What can one say about the endeavour
>>> To bring happiness and benefit to all beings without exception?
>>> This verse describes the intention to help others as superior even to the worship of the Buddhas. As it says in the Sutra Requested by Candrapradipa,
>>> With limitless kinds of offerings
>>> Though they long to be free from suffering,
>>> They hurriedly chase after suffering itself.
>>> Though they long for happiness, in their ignorance,
>>> They destroy it as though their own happiness were their enemy.
>>> Whoever is destitute of happiness
>>> And burdened with many sufferings
>>> Will be filled with every happiness
>>> And cut off from all their suffering,
>>> And their ignorance, too, will be dispelled.
>>> What virtue could equal that?
>>> What friend can compare to it?
>>> What merit is remotely comparable to it?
>>> 3.	Those tormented by suffering
>>> 1. Although they long to be free from suffering, in their ignorance they hurriedly chase after suffering itself and, although they long for happiness, in their ignorance they destroy their own happiness as if it were their enemy. Thus, they possess the cause: ignorance. The benefit for such beings is that ‘their ignorance too will be dispelled.’ The additional benefit of that is they now accumulate merit. No other kind of merit is known which is remotely like this.
>>> 2. The particular benefit for whomever is destitute of happiness is that they are ‘filled with every happiness.’ The praise is, ‘What [virtue] could equal to that?’ [269] 
>>> 3. The benefit for those burdened with many sufferings is they are ‘cut off from all suffering.’ The praise is, ‘What friend is even alike to it?’
>>> If one who repays a helpful deed
>>> Is worthy of some praise,
>>> What can one say of the bodhisattva
>>> Whose excellent deeds are unsolicited? 
>>> Worldly people respect someone who briefly
>>> Gives a little food, contemptuously,
>>> To a few beings, satisfying them only for half a day,
>>> Saying, ‘That was a virtuous deed.’
>>> What can one say then of someone who 
>>> Always gives the unsurpassed happiness
>>> Of the Sugatas to countless sentient beings throughout time, 
>>> The ultimate perfection of their wishes?
>>> Even the giving of food is praised with the words, ‘That was a virtuous deed.’ If one wonders why the bodhisattva is superior, it is because the former has an inferior number of beings: a few; inferior time: one moment; inferior substance: mere food; inferior conduct: with contempt; and inferior benefit: satisfying for half a day, while the bodhisattva is superior in always practising vast giving for great fields of countless sentient beings; for a superior time: throughout time; with a superior substance: the unsurpassed bliss of the Sugatas; and a superior benefit: the ultimate perfection of their wishes.
>>> If one should develop a malevolent intention
>>> Towards such beneficent sons of the conquerors,
>>> The Sage has taught they will remain in the hells
>>> For as many aeons as malevolent thoughts developed.
>>> Nevertheless, if one’s attitude is good,
>>> The results will be even greater.
>>> The sons of the conquerors, with great seriousness,
>>> Never perform nonvirtue and their virtues continuously increase.
>>> With great dedication, they never perform nonvirtue [270] even at the cost of their lives. Rather, their virtues continuously increase. 
>>> I bow down before
>>> Those in whom this sacred jewel of mind is born
>>> And I take refuge in those sources of happiness 
>>> Who bring happiness even to those who harm them.
>>> Bringing happiness even to those who harm them means, out of compassion, they bestow happiness on those who do them harm. It does not mean the happiness arises as a result of the harms committed, for that would contradict the earlier assertion in verse 34.
>>> 4. See The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, pp. 10-12.
>>> 5. This is a reference to Jetāri’s text, A Ritual for Generating Bodhicitta and Receiving the Commitments (D3968). In Jetāri’s liturgy (p. 243a), one first vows three times to ‘take hold of the mind of aspiration and application’, and then vows three times to undertake the bodhisattva training:
>>> ‘ “Just as the Sugatas of the past
>>> Generated bodhicitta,
>>> At all times,
>>> Likewise for the benefit of beings,
>>> I will generate bodhicitta,
>>> ‘ “Just as the Sugatas of the past
>>> Held the bodhisattva trainings—
>>> Likewise for the benefit of beings,
>>> Practise the trainings.”
>>> Chapter 2: Confession of Faults
>>> In order to take hold of this treasure of mind,
>>> I make offerings properly to the oceans of good qualities—
>>> The stainless jewels of the Tathāgata, the holy dharma,
>>> And the sons of the Buddhas.
>>> The basis is the ‘Tathāgata’ and so forth, i.e. the Three Jewels. ‘Stainless jewels’ and ‘oceans of good qualities’ refer to all three of them. Physically and mentally, one ‘makes offerings properly’—i.e. the offerings are magnificent and one’s intentions are pure. 
>>> I offer every flower and fruit there is,
>>> Every kind of restorative,
>>> All the wealth in the world,
>>> And all the clear, refreshing waters.
>>> Likewise, I offer bejewelled mountains,
>>> Secluded and delightful forest groves,
>>> Trees of paradise rich with blossoming flowers,
>>> Many trees with branches laden with excellent fruit,
>>> The beautiful fragrances of gods and men,
>>> All incense, wish granting trees and bejewelled trees,
>>> All kinds of crops, cultivated without effort,
>>> And everything else worthy of offering, all ornamented with
>>> Lakes and pools adorned with lotus flowers,
>>> Mellifluous with the song of wild geese,
>>> In the endlessness of space and in innumerable worlds,
>>> All completely unowned.
>>> Thinking of these, I offer them properly
>>> To the sages, supreme among men, and their sons.
>>> Holy recipients, out of your compassion,
>>> Please accept my offerings and think of me with kindness.
>>> I am without merit and completely destitute;
>>> I have no other wealth to give.
>>> Therefore, protectors, you who think only of the benefit of others,
>>> Please accept these for my benefit.
>>> The first two verses concern the particular things offered, mostly the objects of mankind, while what follows that is the possessions of other kinds of beings. ‘In the endlessness of space and in innumerable worlds’ indicates the particular locus. Being ‘completely unowned’ indicates the particular criterion. ‘The sages, supreme among men, and their sons’ indicates the recipients. Verse 6 indicates the actual application. Verse 7 indicates the particular cause and purpose.
>>> To the conquerors and their sons, I offer
>>> All my bodies. Sublime beings, 
>>> Please always accept them,
>>> And I will be your devoted servant.
>>> When I am under your protection,
>>> I will fearlessly bring benefit to sentient beings in conditioned existence.
>>> I will completely overcome my former nonvirtues
>>> And henceforth cease all other nonvirtues.
>>> The recipients are the conquerors and their sons. The offering substance is all one’s bodies. The practice is indicated by ‘sublime beings, please always accept them’. The type of offering is indicated in line 8d. The purpose of the offering is indicated in lines 9ab. The practice subsequent to the offering is indicated in lines 9cd.
>>> In freshly scented bathing houses,
>>> With crystal floors, clear and bright,
>>> And columns shimmering with jewels,
>>> Decorated with canopies alight with pearls,
>>> To the Tathāgatas and their sons
>>> With many precious vases, filled with 
>>> Scented water that delights the senses, and with many songs
>>> And music, I request to bathe the Buddhas’ forms.
>>> I then wipe dry their bodies with the finest cloths,
>>> Fresh and fragranced with scents.
>>> To the holy ones I offer 
>>> Fragrant robes of appropriate colours.
>>> With all kinds of excellent garments, soft and fine,
>>> And an array of supreme ornaments, I adorn
>>> Ārya Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa,
>>> Avalokiteśvara and the others.
>>> ‘Appropriate colours’ means offering robes of the correct colours for those who dress as monastics, while ornaments and variously coloured garments are offered to those who dress as laypeople. [272]
>>> With supreme scents that permeate
>>> The three thousand-fold world system, I anoint
>>> The bodies of the lords of sages, blazing with light,
>>> Like polishing pure, burnished gold.
>>> To the supreme objects of worship, the lords of sages, I offer
>>> Delightful flowers such as mandaras, lotuses
>>> And utpalas, all sweet-smelling and
>>> Wonderfully laid out in garlands,
>>> And I offer clouds of permeating incense, enchanting to the mind,
>>> From the finest incense sticks,
>>> And I offer many kinds of 
>>> Ambrosial foods and drinks.
>>> I offer jewelled lamps, arranged upon
>>> Rows of golden lotus flowers.
>>> Their grounds fragrant with the perfume
>>> Of flower petals scattered upon it,
>>> I offer vast palaces, resonant with pleasing songs of praise,
>>> Bright and resplendent with hanging ornaments of pearls and jewels,
>>> Ornamenting the vastnesses of space,
>>> To those who have the nature of compassion.
>>> On grounds fragrant with the perfume
>>> Of flower petals scattered upon it,
>>> I offer jewelled lamps, arranged upon
>>> Rows of golden lotus flowers.
>>> I offer to the lords of sages

>>> I present billowing clouds of offerings 
>>> To soothe the sufferings of sentient beings.
>>> May an uninterrupted rain
>>> Of flowers and precious gems descend
>>> Upon all the jewels of holy dharma,
>>> The stupas and statues.
>>> The masters of the tenth bhūmi, who have gained mastery over the six higher perceptions, make offerings to the Buddhas by manifesting light rays which arise from their actions:
>>> Just as Mañjughoṣa and others
>>> Made offerings to the conquerors
>>> Likewise I make offerings
>>> To the Tathāgatas and their sons.
>>> I praise these oceans of good qualities
>>> With oceans of melodious praise.
>>> May these pleasing clouds of melodious praise
>>> Always ascend to their ears.
>>> To the Buddhas of the three times,
>>> To the dharma, and to the supreme among communities,
>>> With bodies as numerous as atoms
>>> I respectfully prostrate.
>>> I prostrate to the bases of bodhicitta,
>>> And to the stupas,
>>> And I prostrate to preceptors, ācāryas,
>>> And the supreme practitioners.
>>> Until the essence of enlightenment,
>>> I take refuge in the Buddha,
>>> And likewise in the dharma,
>>> And in the assembly of bodhisattvas.
>>> 3.	Nature 
>>> 3. Nature
>>> After going for refuge to the Buddha,
>>> And should not take refuge 
>>> To the perfect Buddhas and bodhisattvas
>>> Who dwell in all directions,
>>> And who possess great compassion,
>>> I supplicate you with joined palms.
>>> Having wandered without beginning
>>> In this life and in others, 
>>> I stupidly performed nonvirtues,
>>> Or commanded them to be done.
>>> Compelled by ignorance and delusion,
>>> I took pleasure in this.
>>> Now seeing this was a terrible mistake,
>>> I sincerely confess it to the protectors.
>>> Whatever harm I have done towards
>>> The Three Jewels, my parents, my teachers and others,
>>> Based on the defilements,
>>> And whatever nonvirtues I, burdened with nonvirtue
>>> And afflicted with many faults, have done
>>> With my body, speech or mind, 
>>> These deeds, now utterly unbearable to me,
>>> I confess before the guides of the world.
>>> I will die before
>>> My nonvirtues have been purified.
>>> So that I may be saved from them,
>>> I pray for your protection to come swiftly.
>>> The untrustworthy Lord of Death
>>> Will not wait for me to be ready.
>>> Regardless of whether I am sick or healthy, 
>>> This fleeting life is unstable.
>>> Everything must be left behind and I must go, too.
>>> Yet, without understanding this, 
>>> Because of friends and foes,
>>> I have carried out all kinds of nonvirtue.
>>> My foes will become nothing.
>>> My friends will become nothing.
>>> I, too, will become nothing.
>>> In this way, all of us will become nothing.
>>> Like experiences in dreams,
>>> We get involved with this and that,
>>> But these will become only memories,
>>> For whatever has passed will never be seen again.
>>> The logical subject is the objects of experience, i.e. that which ‘we get involved with’. The conclusion is that they will pass from objects of experience into objects of memory. The reason is that whatever passes away will never be seen again. The example which proves that pervasion6 is their likeness to ‘the experiences in a dream.’
>>> In the short time of this life,
>>> Many friends and foes have already passed,
>>> But whatever unbearable nonvirtues
>>> I carried out because of them still await me.
>>> Not even understanding 
>>> That I, too, am just as temporary as they were,
>>> Out of ignorance, desire and hatred,
>>> I have done many nonvirtues.
>>> If, without respite, day and night,
>>> This life is running out,
>>> And there is no granting of an extension,
>>> Why would death not come for someone like me?
>>> Lying on my death bed,
>>> Though surrounded by all my friends and family,
>>> The sensations of life ending
>>> Will be experienced by me alone.
>>> When seized by the messengers of the Lord of Death,
>>> What good is family, what good are friends?
>>> Merit alone will protect me then,
>>> But I have never really relied on it.
>>> Oh protectors—I was unconcerned and,
>>> Not realizing this would be so terrifying,
>>> I carried out many nonvirtues
>>> For the sake of this impermanent life.
>>> Even now, when someone is told
>>> They are to be taken to a torture chamber, they are terrified.
>>> Their appearance quickly changes:
>>> Their mouth becomes dry, their eyes bulge and so on.
>>> What need to mention the utter despair
>>> Of being in the grasp of the terrifying
>>> Messengers of the Lord of Death,
>>> And being sick with terror.
>>> The first two lines give an example of fear for the harms of this life. The next two lines complete the example. The second verse relates the example to the harms of future lives.
>>> ‘Can anyone protect me
>>> From such a great horror?’
>>> With gaping eyes and a terrified aspect,
>>> I will search in the four directions for a refuge,
>>> But not seeing any refuge in the four directions,
>>> I will be enveloped in despair.
>>> Then, when I have no refuge,
>>> What am I going to do?
>>> Therefore, to the conquerors, the protectors,
>>> Who strive in their purpose of protecting beings,

>>> I go for refuge from this day forth.
>>> In the dharma taken to heart, 
>>> Which dispels fear of saṃsāra,
>>> And in the assembly of bodhisattvas,
>>> I likewise completely take refuge.
>>> The Buddhas are ‘conquerors’ of the benefit of self in respect of abandoning the defilements and possessing good qualities. They are ‘protectors’ of beings in that they fulfil the benefit of others:
>>> Thus the protectors of beings [278] strive in these ways, using manifold powers and dispelling fears of saṃsāra. The ‘dharma’ means the dharma of realization which, when it is taken to heart, is cessation—freedom of the dhātu from adventitious impurities—and the dharma of the path, which dispels fears of saṃsāra. The ‘saṅgha’ means the community of bodhisattvas.

>>> In the virtue which alleviates the sufferings
>>> Of all beings in the lower realms,
>>> And places those who are suffering in happiness,
>>> I gladly rejoice.
>>> The first two lines are rejoicing in the cause: virtue which alleviates the sufferings of the lower realms. It is this virtue which creates the higher realms. The next line is rejoicing in the result of that: those who are suffering are placed in happiness—the happiness of saṃsāra, which is like the happiness of scratching an itch.
>>> In the gathering of virtue
>>> Which causes enlightenment, I rejoice.
>>> In the complete liberation 
>>> From the suffering of saṃsāric birth, I rejoice.
>>> In the enlightenment of the protectors
>>> And their sons’ attainment of the bhūmis, I rejoice.
>>> In the ocean of virtue in generating the resolution

>>> And in the virtuous deeds for the benefit 
>>> Of sentient beings, I rejoice.
>>> Folding my hands, I implore

>>> Please shine the light of dharma
>>> For sentient beings suffering in darkness.
>>> Folding my hands, I implore
>>> The conquerors who wish to pass beyond torment:
>>> Please do not leave these creatures to their blindness
>>> But stay here for countless aeons.
>>> Having done all this,
>>> Whatever I may have gathered by this virtue,

>>> Nirvāṇa is attained by giving everything up.
>>> Nirvāṇa is my goal,
>>> And to give everything at once
>>> To sentient beings is the supreme gift.
>>> Nirvāṇa will be attained by giving up all. Because one’s intent is to attain nirvāṇa, that is what should be done. The third line indicates sentient beings as the precious field of giving. Giving up all ‘at once’ means completely letting go of both that which is appropriate to be given and that which is appropriate not to be given.

>>> •	Faith in the cause—the bodhisattva conduct
>>> •	When an act is committed which constitutes a defeat in the śrāvaka tradition, if it is motivated by some opportunity to benefit others, it counts only as a resembling downfall for bodhisattvas.4
>>> What is perfect moral conduct? It is holding the prātimokṣa vows [support] and it is the practice of the bodhisattva trainings [supported].6 [285] 
>>> ‘If one does not abandon the intention of renunciation, is it not a contradiction to say that a śrāvaka who commits murder for the benefit of others has broken the vow, while a bodhisattva has merely committed a resembling downfall and not broken it?’
>>> The spiritual friend is
>>> Learned in the Mahāyāna
>>> And supreme in the discipline of the bodhisattvas.
>>> I should never leave him even at the cost of my life.9
>>> If it is possible to practise the three activities—the moral discipline of vows, gathering virtuous dharmas and benefitting sentient beings—then one should maintain all three but, if not, practise whichever of these are appropriate, or just rely on some of the rules of conduct of vows.10 If one does not do so, the vow one has taken will be violated. In the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutra, it says that if one does not give what one has promised, one will be reborn in hell and if one does not give what one has dedicated, one will be reborn as a hungry ghost. What can be said therefore of someone who, having made the great commitment to accomplish the benefit of others, leaves it merely to fade away?
>>> Thus, in accord with line 3.24d, ‘I will gradually practise the trainings’, beginners should mainly train in [the moral discipline of]19 the vow, devoted conduct practitioners20 should mainly train in the gathering of virtues and those who have attained the bhūmis should mainly train in benefitting sentient beings.
>>> Accordingly, those who with intelligence
>>> Have lucidly taken hold of bodhicitta,
>>> In order to increase it,
>>> Should praise the mind with these words:
>>> Now, my life is fruitful.
>>> I have properly attained human existence.
>>> Today, born into the family of the Buddhas,
>>> I have become a Buddha’s child.
>>> The four lines of the second verse indicate, respectively, that one’s life has meaning, not to waste one’s freedoms and endowments, that it is possible to attain buddhahood and that one is an heir of the conquerors. 
>>> Whatever I undertake to do, my actions
>>> Will be consistent with this lineage.
>>> Nothing I do will corrupt
>>> This faultless, noble lineage.
>>> Like a blind man finding
>>> A gem in a pile of rubbish,

>>> 1.	The power to dispel suffering
>>> 2.	The power to dispel obscurations
>>> 1. The power to dispel suffering
>>> This is the supreme elixir of life,
>>> Vanquishing death’s sovereignty over the world.
>>> It is an inexhaustible treasure,
>>> Dispelling beings’ sufferings.
>>> It is the supreme remedy,
>>> Relieving the sicknesses of beings.
>>> It is a tree to rest under for all beings 
>>> Who are wandering and exhausted on saṃsāric paths.
>>> The suffering of bad rebirths:
>>> It is an open bridge, leading them
>>> Over bad rebirths to freedom.
>>> 2. The power to dispel obscurations
>>> It is the shining moon of mind
>>> Which dispels the misery of beings’ defilements.
>>> This indicates dispelling the obscurations of the defilements.
>>> It is the great sun which brings an end
>>> To the gloom of beings’ ignorance.
>>> It is the fresh butter extracted
>>> From churning the milk of the holy dharma.
>>> Churning the milk of the holy dharma indicates ascertaining the meaning of the explanans, experiencing the excellent teachings. The fresh butter indicates liberation by seeing the truth. 
>>> Beings wandering abroad on the paths of conditioned existence,
>>> Wishing to have happiness,
>>> Will encounter this supreme happiness,
>>> And those great wanderers will at last be contented.
>>> Having wandered on the paths of conditioned existence, if they desire the highest bliss, they may attain the bliss of meditation. 
>>> Today, in the presence of all the protectors,
>>> Until they have attained buddhahood itself,
>>> I invite beings to every happiness.
>>> May the gods, demigods and all the rest be joyful.
>>> This verse constitutes an invitation. By whom is it made? By oneself. Invited to what? To the happiness of the gods for as long as they have not yet attained buddhahood itself. Who is the witness of this? It is done before all the Buddhas.
>>> 12. In the Śikṣā-samuccaya, Śāntideva relates this as follows:
>>> “When the Tathāgata Akṣobhya was still a bodhisattva, he said this:
>>> Through understanding.’” ’ (The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, pp. 15-16)
>>> Chapter 4: Concern
>>> The training in bodhicitta, which is the cooperating condition, can be explained in relation to the six perfections. Although there is no specific chapter on giving, the first perfection, its practice is nevertheless explained throughout the text. [290] The chapter on Clear Comprehension explains the perfection of moral conduct. The following four chapters [‘Patience’ through to ‘Wisdom’] are concerned with their eponymous perfections. The chapter on Concern is taught before these as the general cause of practice. Some other commentators have explained both Concern and Clear Comprehension as the general causes of practice, while the chapter on Patience shows how to practise the antidotes and abandon remaining obstacles [chapter 6]. This is followed by an explanation of reliance on the accompanying training [chapter 7] and then calm abiding and insight meditation [chapters 8 and 9] are the seeing of the true nature of the antidotes themselves.
>>> Having firmly grasped bodhicitta 
>>> In this way, a conqueror’s son 
>>> Should never neglect it,
>>> But instead strive never to violate the training. 
>>> In respect to inherent misdeeds in the moral conduct of the vow: If a person is harming the teachings of the Buddha and leading beings to the lower realms, etc. and there is a peaceful method to stop them2 which does not involve killing them but, despite that, one kills them to stop them, [291] it would be the heavy fault3 of practising a dispensation even though a formal rule applies.4 In the case that one could not stop them by any other deed apart from killing them and so one kills them, it is a resembling downfall. If they are not killed, it is a resembling non-downfall.5 By contrast, according to the texts of the śrāvakas, such a deed is never permitted even if one sees that it would benefit others.
>>> Thus in order to alleviate the terrible sufferings of such sentient beings, one should be happy even to go to the lower realms by becoming stained with such faults. Such is the attitude of thinking only of how to benefit others. However, if one does not have this attitude, since one’s motivation is tainted with the mind of the defilements, it would be an actual downfall, though one would have the conceit that it was a resembling downfall.
>>> In respect to gathering virtuous dharmas: When engaged in yoga [i.e. a practice of gathering virtuous dharmas], seeing some external deed that would benefit beings, one accomplishes their benefit by that other means [i.e. abandons the yogic practice to do so]. If their benefit could have been accomplished by any other means without abandoning one’s engagement in samādhi, it is the first misdeed [i.e. practising a dispensation even though a formal rule is present]. If there was no other way to accomplish their benefit and so one abandoned the practice of yoga in order to do it, [292] it is a resembling downfall. If one did not accomplish their benefit, it is a resembling non-downfall.7 
>>> In respect to benefitting sentient beings: When engaged, for example, in accomplishing the benefit of many beings, one sees among them one being harming those who are practising meditation and developing good qualities and one sees that in his future life, that harmful being will himself be harmed by his actions. For the benefit of that one being, one should accomplish the benefit of the many who have good qualities by some other means or, by another means, overcome the harm that one being is doing in this life and to his future lives. If such means are available but one simply abandons accomplishing a benefit, it is the first fault [practising the dispensation though the formal rule applies]. If it was not possible to accomplish the benefit of the many by any other means and nor was it possible to overcome both the harm done by one person to the many and to his own future life, one should abandon the benefit of the one. However, one should still try to help the many and pacify the harms done to them and the harms done to the harm-doer himself. That situation is a resembling downfall. If one does not do so, it is a resembling non-downfall.8
>>> Whatever I have undertaken rashly
>>> Or not properly thought through,
>>> Even if I have promised to do it,
>>> I should reconsider, asking myself, ‘Should I stop?’
>>> The Buddhas and their sons
>>> Examine things with their great wisdom,
>>> And even I can examine them,
>>> So why would I hesitate in doing so?
>>> ‘Rashly’ means without conducting analysis. ‘Not properly thought through’ means doing something misconceived. One should subsequently question whether such activities should be abandoned. [293] Since the Buddhas and their sons examine their activities, one should cease that which has not been properly analysed and since one can also examine it oneself, one should cease that which is rash.9
>>> 1.	One goes to the lower realms
>>> 2.	The benefit of others is damaged
>>> 3.	The attainment of the bhūmis is obstructed
>>> 1. One goes to the lower realms
>>> Having made this commitment,
>>> If I do not act to fulfil it,
>>> Then, since I will have deceived all sentient beings,
>>> What kind of rebirth will I take?
>>> If it is taught that someone who intended to give 
>>> Some slight, unremarkable thing,
>>> But then did not do so, 
>>> Will be reborn as a hungry ghost,
>>> Then, having sincerely intended to bring them
>>> To unsurpassed bliss,
>>> If I then deceive all sentient beings,
>>> To what sort of happy rebirth shall I proceed?
>>> The first verse is the example and the second is the application of the example. If, having had an intention, one does not fulfil it, one will be reborn as a hungry ghost. In the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutra, it is taught that even for something slight, one will be reborn as a ghost if, having intended to give it, one does not give it and one will be reborn in hell if, having promised to give it, one does not give it. What can one say then of someone who promises sentient beings the freedom of enlightenment but then does not free them?
>>> To give up bodhicitta
>>> But still be liberated;
>>> Such a thing is inconceivable.
>>> Only the Omniscient One could comprehend it.
>>> Although he gave up bodhicitta, he was not reborn in the lower realms but attained liberation from saṃsāra. This was due to his application of the antidote to his nonvirtue. What is that antidote? To do such a thing is inconceivable, i.e. it can be comprehended only by the Omniscient One. Others say that giving up bodhicitta does not mean giving up the enlightenment of the śrāvakas.11 [294] However, I will not go into this point here.12
>>> 2. The benefit of others is damaged
>>> This is the most serious of downfalls
>>> For a bodhisattva,
>>> The abandonment of bodhicitta is, among downfalls, the most serious. Is this a serious downfall for śrāvakas? No, only for bodhisattvas. How serious is the abandonment of bodhicitta for them?
>>> For, if should it occur,
>>> The benefit of all beings is discarded.
>>> Should someone even for a moment
>>> Interrupt or prevent this merit,
>>> Since the benefit of beings is diminished,
>>> Nothing can stop him going to the lower realms.
>>> Those who interrupt another’s merit create a karmic obscuration for themselves, and it is impossible to benefit others through such an obscuration. Therefore, nothing will prevent them going to the lower realms. 
>>> If destroying the happiness of even one sentient being
>>> Will harm me,
>>> What need to mention destroying
>>> The happiness of all beings, as vast as space?
>>> Destroying the happiness of one sentient being is like ending a life. To abandon bodhicitta is to destroy the happiness of all sentient beings without exception because one cuts the continuity of the aspiration and application to achieve the happiness of others.
>>> 3. The attainment of the bhūmis is obstructed
>>> Thus, when vacillating in saṃsāra,
>>> Sometimes with the power of downfalls,
>>> Sometimes with the power of bodhicitta,
>>> The attainment of the bhūmis will be obstructed for a long time. 
>>> [295] Because the contamination of bodhicitta with downfalls creates obstacles to the accomplishment of the path, the attainment of the bhūmis will be obstructed for a long time. It is like the bodhisattva is travelling in a chariot drawn by cattle.
>>> 1.	Concern to abandon nonvirtue

>>> If I do not persevere from now on,
>>> I will descend to lower and lower rebirths.
>>> Although there have been innumerable Buddhas
>>> Who worked for the benefit of all beings,
>>> My own faults excluded me
>>> From their restorative reach.
>>> Moreover, if I continue in this way,
>>> Again and again it will end the same way:
>>> Diseased and fettered in the lower realms,
>>> Shattered and cut apart.
>>> The arising of a Tathāgata,
>>> Faith, obtaining a human birth
>>> And the conditions for cultivating virtue
>>> Are very rare. When will they be attained again?
>>> The arising of a Tathāgata is the attainment of endowment based upon other. Faith in the remaining teachings and obtaining a human birth are explained as endowments of oneself, as well as freedoms. The conditions for cultivating virtue are the mental basis. They are rare, i.e. they are acquired infrequently. 
>>> Today, at least, I am not sick.
>>> I have food to eat and am not afflicted. 
>>> But this life is fleeting and deceptive,
>>> And this body is on loan only for a little while.
>>> One has obtained circumstances which are today free from contrary conditions, such as being without obstructions like sickness. One possesses harmonious conditions, as expressed in the second line. Nevertheless, this life is fleeting, i.e. unstable and deceptive, i.e. it will cease. It is on loan, i.e. possessed only temporarily. ‘Today’ means the time when the sun is visible, or else it means the length of a day, i.e. the duration for which one is not sick is like the length of a day. [296]
>>> 4. No virtuous deeds in the lower realms
>>> 3.	The inability to return from the lower realms
>>> My conduct being the way it is,
>>> I will not attain a human body again
>>> And, if I do not attain a human body,
>>> There will be only nonvirtue and no virtue.
>>> Even when I do have the chance to practise virtue,
>>> If I fail to do so,
>>> What will I do when I am
>>> Completely obscured by the sufferings of the lower realms?
>>> What does one fail to do despite having the chance? Accomplishing virtue, the basis of the higher realms, even though there is the opportunity to do it. The lower realms in which one is consumed by sufferings are those rebirths as a hell-being, hungry ghost or animal. 
>>> 3. The inability to return from the lower realms
>>> Not practising any virtues,
>>> But gathering many nonvirtues,
>>> For hundreds of millions of aeons
>>> I will not even hear the words ‘happy rebirth’.
>>> It is because of this the Bhagavān said
>>> That the difficulty of attaining a human birth
>>> Is like a turtle putting its neck through
>>> A wooden yoke adrift on a great ocean.
>>> 2. Concern to cultivate virtue
>>> 1.	Many nonvirtues were previously gathered
>>> 1. Many nonvirtues were previously gathered
>>> If just a moment of nonvirtue
>>> Can lead to an aeon in the Avīci Hell,
>>> What need to mention my not proceeding to a happy rebirth,
>>> With nonvirtues collected since beginningless time in saṃsāra?
>>> A momentary nonvirtue which leads to rebirth in the Avīci Hell is, as previously explained in verse 1.34, a malevolent intention towards a bodhisattva who is generating bodhicitta. Such nonvirtues have been collected in saṃsāra, from time without beginning, through which, while they are not purified, one will not proceed to happy birth.
>>> Even after having suffered such experiences,
>>> I still won’t be free of them
>>> For, even while undergoing them,
>>> I will commit yet more nonvirtue.
>>> 3.	The fault in future lives [297]
>>> Having acquired this kind of freedom,
>>> If I do not cultivate virtue,
>>> There could be no greater deception,
>>> And no greater delusion.
>>> The deception here is thinking of this life. The delusion is not understanding the harm for future lives.
>>> So, having understood this,
>>> If later in confusion I stop trying,
>>> Then the hour of my approaching death
>>> Will stir up extreme distress.
>>> 3. The fault in future lives
>>> When my body is burning
>>> For a long time in the torturous fires of hell,
>>> Without doubt, my mind will also be tormented
>>> By the unbearable fire of remorse.
>>> Having somehow attained this beneficial state,
>>> Extremely difficult to find,
>>> Freedom, being extremely difficult to find, is precious and is beneficial, since, being the basis of such things as moral conduct, it brings great benefit. These two lines indicate the attainment of this.
>>> While I have this understanding,
>>> If still I am led back to the hells,
>>> Like someone manipulated by mantras,
>>> I must have lost my mind.
>>> I don’t even know who is manipulating me.
>>> Who is this inside of me?
>>> Enemies like hatred and craving
>>> Don’t have hands or feet,
>>> Aren’t courageous or intelligent,
>>> And yet I act like their slave.
>>> While they remain in my mind
>>> They can harm me whenever they want,
>>> And I patiently accept it without any resentment,
>>> But this is not a situation that warrants patience.
>>> There are two kinds of enemies: ordinary enemies, who are unable to create suffering for oneself, and enemy defilements who are able. These two are indicated in the next two verses, respectively:
>>> Even if all the gods and demigods
>>> Stood against me as enemies,
>>> They could not lead me into the fires 
>>> Of the Avīci Hell, or send me there.
>>> But these enemies, the mighty defilements,
>>> Can put me there in an instant,
>>> Where Mount Meru and even its very ashes
>>> Are consumed on contact.
>>> What enemy is so interminable,
>>> Without beginning or end, as my own defilements?
>>> No other enemy
>>> Endures as long as they do.
>>> When treated well and respected,
>>> Enemies are cooperative and content
>>> But, when the defilements are respected,
>>> They return only pain and suffering.
>>> Accordingly, these being my old, implacable enemies,
>>> The sole cause of vastly increasing all kinds of harm,
>>> If I make room for them in my heart,
>>> How can I be unafraid or enjoy saṃsāra?
>>> They are the prison guards of saṃsāra who,
>>> In the hells and elsewhere, become my killers and executioners.
>>> So, if they remain in my mind, abiding in the web of attachment,
>>> How can I be happy?
>>> 3.	To be a cause of grasping: their ‘abiding in the web of attachment’, where attachment means the habitual imprints of grasping at substantiality.
>>> Therefore, as long I have not with certainty
>>> Vanquished this enemy, I will never stop persevering.
>>> For how long should one persevere? For as long as this enemy has not been vanquished, i.e. until the defilements have been abandoned. 
>>> Growing angry upon some slight, fleeting injury, 
>>> The proud and haughty will not sleep until their enemy has been vanquished.
>>> When receiving a slight, fleeting injury, some will not sleep until that ordinary enemy has been defeated. Who does this? Those who become angry, being inflated with pride.
>>> On the battlefield, they are eager to vanquish 
>>> People with defilements, who would suffer an ordinary death anyway.
>>> Disregarding the pain of being pierced by arrows or swords,
>>> They will not retreat until their objective is won.
>>> They may not have been killed, yet those who have defilements should be the objects of compassion, being bound by the suffering of dying naturally. Those who are eager to vanquish their ordinary enemies ‘will not retreat’, i.e. instead of turning to flee, they remain on the battlefield. For how long? For as long as their objective is not achieved, i.e. until they have won. What makes this difficult? They must ‘disregard the pain of being pierced by arrows or swords’. 
>>> So, what need to mention that I should not be discouraged or frustrated
>>> To be caused even one hundred thousand sufferings,
>>> When striving to finally vanquish my true, natural enemies,
>>> Who cause all my endless suffering?
>>> In wishing to vanquish one’s true, natural enemies—the defilements—what need is there to mention that one should not become discouraged or frustrated? What could make one discouraged? One hundred thousand sufferings. [300] Why are the defilements one’s natural enemies? Because they are the cause of all one’s endless suffering.
>>> 2.	Benefit of other
>>> If scars inflicted by meaningless enemies
>>> Can be shown off on the body like trophies,
>>> What trouble is suffering to me,
>>> When I am striving to achieve a great benefit?
>>> 2. Benefit of other
>>> If even fishermen, butchers, farmers, etc.
>>> Thinking only of their livelihoods, 
>>> Put up with the discomforts of heat and cold,
>>> Why have I no patience for the sake of beings’ happiness?
>>> To liberate from the defilements 
>>> Beings of the ten directions, as far as the ends of space,
>>> Was my promise but, when I made it,
>>> I was not free from defilements myself.
>>> Not understanding my own limitations,
>>> I spoke without knowing how insane this was.
>>> The first two lines indicate the scope of the vow to benefit others. The remaining lines indicate that the vow will not be fulfilled until the defilements have been abandoned.
>>> But now I should never turn back from
>>> Vanquishing the defilements. 
>>> I will be fixated on this,
>>> And full of resentment, wage war
>>> Against the defilements, except those
>>> Which destroy the other defilements.
>>> It would be better to be burned alive
>>> Or decapitated
>>> Than to be constantly grovelling
>>> To the enemy defilements.
>>> Though ordinary enemies may be driven from our homelands,
>>> They resettle elsewhere,
>>> And return when they have recovered their power,
>>> But the nature of the enemy defilements is not like this.
>>> These pathetic defilements, cast out by the eye of wisdom,
>>> The defilements are pathetic, or miserable, i.e. they have little power against being cast out by their antidote, the eye of wisdom.
>>> And extirpated from my mind, where can they go?
>>> Where can they settle to hurt me again?
>>> And yet, weak-willed, I give up without even trying.
>>> The defilements are not within objects, nor within the senses,
>>> Nor in anything else, yet, wherever they are, they harm all beings.
>>> They are like illusions. So, giving up this heartfelt fear, I will cultivate the perseverance to achieve wisdom.
>>> Why should I be tormented in places like the hells for no reason?
>>> Having considered this, I will strive
>>> To fulfil the training as it has been explained.
>>> If he doesn’t listen to the doctor’s instructions,
>>> How can the patient be cured by the medicine?
>>> 1. These are given in the Ākāśagarbha Sutra and quoted in full by Śāntideva in the Śikṣā-samuccaya. See The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, pp. 63-68.
>>> ‘If it was possible to benefit them in some other way but one gave up samādhi, it is practising a dispensation even though a formal rule is available. If in order to accomplish their vast benefit, one abandons yoga, it is resembling downfall. If one remains in yoga having abandoned their benefit, it is a resembling non-downfall.’
>>> 9. In other commentaries, line 4.3d is explained as unhesitatingly practising the bodhisattva conduct, e.g. Prajñākaramati (W21708, p. 79): ‘What doubts could remain? Therefore, it is logical to exert oneself fully in such a promise.’ 
>>> ‘My own lama [Sapan] said that since such cases are inconceivable, one should never abandon bodhicitta… In the White Lotus of Holy Dharma Sutra (H116, p.52-53) Śāriputra’s final enlightenment as the completely perfect Buddha Padmaguru [c.f. ‘Padmaprabha (padma’i ’od)’ in H116] is predicted. Since it is impossible for a Buddha not to previously generate bodhicitta, it seems Śāriputra only appeared to abandon [bodhicitta].’

>>> 3.	Making effort to guard the mind
>>> 1. By guarding the mind, one guards all
>>> Those who want to guard the training
>>> Must always carefully guard their minds.
>>> If one fails to guard the mind,
>>> It is impossible to guard the training.
>>> While the rampaging elephant of mind
>>> Creates the ravages of the Avīci Hell,
>>> An actual wild and untamed elephant
>>> Cannot cause anything like that destruction.
>>> When the rope of constant mindfulness
>>> Restrains the elephant of mind,
>>> All troubles subside,
>>> And all virtues fall into my hands. 
>>> Tigers, lions, elephants, bears,
>>> Snakes, every kind of enemy,
>>> The prison guards of the hells,
>>> Demons and ogres,
>>> Will all be restrained
>>> By restraining mind alone,
>>> And will all be subjugated
>>> By subjugating mind alone.
>>> The prison guards of hell are dangers of the next life, while the others are dangers in this life. One ‘restrains’ them with the rope of mindfulness and one ‘subjugates’ them with clear comprehension.
>>> 1.	All faults depend upon mind
>>> 2.	All virtues depend upon mind
>>> 1. All faults depend upon mind
>>> In this way, the teacher of perfect truth himself said
>>> That all dangers, 
>>> And all the infinite sufferings
>>> Arise from mind.
>>> ‘Dangers’ means the harms of this life. ‘Sufferings’ means the harms of future lives. These, it is taught, arise from mind. As it says in the Cloud of Jewels Sutra:
>>> Did anyone deliberately make 
>>> The weapons of the hell-beings?
>>> Who made the molten iron ground?
>>> Where did these hosts of women come from?
>>> The Sage has taught that all these things
>>> Come from a nonvirtuous mind.
>>> Since the weapons of the hell-beings, etc. have no creator apart from mind, they are appearances that accord with a mind that generates nonvirtue. The Sage taught in the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutra that by the power of one’s actions [karma], one sees the women who one formerly looked upon [with attachment].2
>>> Thus, in the three realms,
>>> There is nothing to fear apart from mind.
>>> 2. All virtues depend upon mind
>>> These all depend upon mind:
>>> 2.	Moral conduct
>>> ‘If the perfection of giving
>>> Means dispelling the poverty of beings,
>>> How did the earlier protectors perfect it,
>>> When beings are still poor?’
>>> It is taught that the perfection of giving
>>> Is the intention to give to all beings
>>> All of one’s possessions, along with the results of doing so.
>>> In that sense, it is mind itself.
>>> The perfection of giving was completed by those protectors. By what cause? By fulfilling their intention to give to all beings all of their possessions, along with the results of doing that.
>>> 2. Moral conduct
>>> ‘Where has the killing of fish and other creatures
>>> Been eradicated?’
>>> The Sage has taught that the intention to abandon this
>>> Is the perfection of moral conduct.
>>> ‘If the completion of moral conduct is the complete nonexistence of harm done to sentient beings, all the places where fish and so forth are killed would have been eradicated but there has been no such eradication. It follows that the perfection of moral conduct is incomplete.’ 
>>> It is taught that the protectors of the past did complete the perfection of moral conduct. By what cause? By the intention to abandon harm, as the Sage has said. 
>>> Unpleasant beings are as vast as space;
>>> Defeating them would take forever.
>>> But if I overcome this one angry mind,
>>> It would be like defeating all enemies.
>>> If I were to cover all the land with leather,
>>> How much leather would it take?
>>> But if I just put leather on my shoes,
>>> It is as if the whole world is covered.
>>> Likewise I can never force
>>> All external things to change their course.
>>> But if I could turn around just this mind of mine,
>>> What need would there be to change anything else?
>>> Here mind-dependence is demonstrated by example and then it is negated that this can be achieved by dependence upon body and speech:
>>> While simply cultivating a clear mind
>>> Results in rebirth in realms like that of Brahmā,
>>> Not even a great many acts of body and mind,
>>> Being of lesser modes of conduct, can result in this.
>>> The first two lines refer to the examples from the Parinirvāṇa Sutra of how a mother’s feeling of love for her dying child and the great love of a mother and daughter swept away in a river led to their rebirth in the realm of Brahmā. The second two lines, negating the dependence upon body and speech, indicate they are ‘lesser modes of conduct’, i.e. they are inferior activities.
>>> All recitations and austerities, 
>>> Even if performed extensively,
>>> Are useless, so the Omniscient One has taught,
>>> If practised with a wavering mind.
>>> Those who do not understand the secret of mind,
>>> The supreme lord of dharmas,
>>> May wish to have happiness and end their suffering,
>>> But their wishes are futile and they will wander in vain.
>>> The ‘lord of dharmas’ means ultimate truth. It is also the ‘secret of mind’, i.e. the reality of mind, which is emptiness itself. This secret is not comprehended by those of inferior fortune. Not understanding it, their wishes are ‘futile’, i.e. they do not attain liberation and they ‘wander in vain’, i.e. they wander in saṃsāra.
>>> 3. One should make effort to guard the mind3
>>> 3.	A perspective for guarding the mind in this way
>>> 4.	The reason it makes sense to guard it
>>> Therefore, my mind
>>> Should be skilfully held and guarded.
>>> ‘Holding skilfully’ [305] means holding a virtuous intent with mindfulness. ‘Guarding skilfully’ means not failing to act with clear comprehension.
>>> Without the discipline of guarding the mind,
>>> What is the point of many other disciplines?
>>> The ‘discipline of guarding the mind’ means the discipline of perfectly holding the mind as opposed to unconducive conditions such as vacillating moral conduct. ‘Many other disciplines’ are external disciplines apart from that, such as ritual bathing and wearing a Brahmā thread.4
>>> 3. A perspective for guarding the mind in this way
>>> Like being careful to protect a wound
>>> In the midst of a jostling crowd,
>>> So I will constantly guard this wound of a mind
>>> In the midst of bad people.
>>> 4. The reason it makes sense to guard it
>>> If, frightened of a little pain,
>>> I am careful of a wound,
>>> Why do I not protect the wound of mind
>>> Out of fear of the Crushing Hell?
>>> If one is frightened of a little bit of pain from a wound, why is one not frightened of the suffering of the hells?
>>> If he can keep to this conduct,
>>> Then whether among bad people
>>> Or a group of women,
>>> The vow-holder’s stability will not be impaired. 
>>> If one can keep to the conduct of protecting the mind, then when among a group of bad people, one’s stability will not be impaired, i.e. the intentions of nonvirtuous friends will not cause defilements for oneself. One’s stability will also not be impaired when among a group of women, i.e. though they have thirty-two modes of deception to steal one’s moral conduct,5 one cannot be budged. 
>>> It is better to have no money, no respect,
>>> And no bodily subsistence,
>>> And better even for every other virtue to degenerate,
>>> Than for the mind for degenerate.
>>> Not having attachment to the things of this world is better than having no money or respect, or no subsistence of body or mind. Better than the degeneration of other virtues means it is better than the degeneration of virtues conducive to merit and even those conducive to liberation. ‘Mind’ here refers to the mind of a Mahāyānist.

>>> 3.	Guarding mindfulness as the means of guarding clear comprehension
>>> To those of you who want to guard your mind,
>>> I implore you, with folded hands:
>>> Protect mindfulness and clear comprehension
>>> With all your might!
>>> Mindfulness is not forgetting to think of virtue. Clear comprehension is distinguishing what is to be done from what is not to be done. 
>>> 2. The faults of lacking mindfulness and clear comprehension
>>> 3.	Moral conduct will not flourish
>>> People disturbed by sickness
>>> Have no strength to do anything.
>>> Similarly, those disturbed by defilements
>>> Also have no strength to do anything.
>>> Someone whose mind lacks clear comprehension
>>> May hear, reflect and meditate,
>>> But he will not keep it in his memory.
>>> It will leak like water from a vase.
>>> 3. Moral conduct will not flourish
>>> Many who had learning, faith,
>>> And dedicated enthusiasm,
>>> By the fault of losing clear comprehension,
>>> Became embroiled in downfalls.
>>> Learning is the excellent condition, faith is the excellent cause and dedicated enthusiasm is the excellent application. Despite holding these, one can still be stained by downfalls. This is like monks who have been sick, etc. forgetting their dispensation on the permitted times of eating and thus becoming stained by downfalls.6
>>> The thieves who want to steal my clear comprehension
>>> Will show up after my loss of mindfulness.
>>> Then, after they have stolen my merit,
>>> I will go to the lower realms.
>>> This band of robbers, the defilements,
>>> Are waiting for a good opportunity.
>>> When they find it, they will steal all my virtues
>>> And destroy the life of a good rebirth.
>>> 3. Guarding mindfulness as the means of guarding clear comprehension
>>> 3.	How to definitively generate clear comprehension through mindfulness
>>> Consequently, I should never let mindfulness stray
>>> Past the gateway of mind.
>>> If it ever leaves, remembering
>>> The horrors of the lower realms, I must get it back.
>>> If mindfulness leaves for somewhere else, i.e. if it is lost, then it must be gotten back, i.e. restored to its former condition. By what consideration? By remembering the horrors of rebirth in the lower realms.
>>> Through associating with teachers
>>> And attending abbots
>>> With fear, fortunate ones who have respect
>>> Easily develop mindfulness. 
>>> Through association with teachers who bestow the scriptural transmissions and with holy people, one will easily develop mindfulness. How is it developed through those two? By having fear, i.e. developing a sense of shame, toward abbots, i.e. when attending7 the teachers and the holy persons. For whom will it develop? For fortunate ones who have respect. 
>>> At all times I am 
>>> In the presence of
>>> All the Buddhas and bodhisattvas
>>> Whose vision is completely without obstruction.
>>> With this in mind, I should have
>>> Shame, respect and fear.
>>> For oneself, i.e. from one’s own self-perspective, one should have shame by being humble, and have respect for training and fear of downfalls. What causes that? It comes from thinking that at all times one is in the presence of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. How is one in their presence? In the sense that their vision is completely unobstructed. 
>>> It will also remind me
>>> Again and again of the Buddha.
>>> 3. How to definitively generate clear comprehension through mindfulness [308]
>>> When mindfulness stays,
>>> Guarding the gateway of mind,
>>> Clear comprehension will come.
>>> Then, even if it is lost, it will return.
>>> 3. How to train in the conduct of guarding the mind with mindfulness and clear comprehension
>>> 3.	Training in the conduct of benefitting sentient beings
>>> At the outset, having found a mind like this
>>> With some fault,
>>> At that time, like a block of wood,
>>> I should remain undiverted.
>>> ‘At the outset’ means before one engages in an activity. ‘A mind like this with some fault’ means wanting to engage in negative physical activities. To remain like a block of wood at that time means, by overcoming the negative mind, one’s attention does not get distracted elsewhere. 
>>> I should never look all around 
>>> Distractedly for no reason,
>>> But rather, with a resolute mind,
>>> Look with eyes lowered.
>>> In order to relax my gaze,
>>> I can from time to time look in some direction
>>> And, if someone appears in my field of vision,
>>> I should look up and greet them.
>>> In order to identify dangers on the road, etc.
>>> I can repeatedly survey the area.
>>> Pausing and having looked ahead,
>>> I should then look behind.
>>> Having checked both ahead and behind,
>>> I can continue on or turn back.
>>> Similarly, in all circumstances,
>>> I should proceed after understanding whatever is appropriate.
>>> Having prepared for some activity 
>>> I should occasionally check to see
>>> If I am remaining as intended.
>>> Tying the crazed elephant of mind
>>> To the great pillar of contemplating the dharma,
>>> I will always make an effort to check
>>> It has not escaped.
>>> Whoever perseveres in this samādhi
>>> Will not lose control even for a moment.
>>> ‘Where is this mind of mine going?’
>>> In this way, I will acutely scrutinize my mind.
>>> The first verse indicates placing the untethered mind’s attention on virtue and the second verse indicates that by doing so, the mind is stabilized. ‘Persevering in this samādhi’ means placing one’s attention on virtue as opposed to merely practising calm abiding meditation. 
>>> If, due to some danger or celebration,
>>> This is not possible, I can relax.
>>> It is taught in this regard that
>>> At times of giving, moral conduct can be overlooked.
>>> It says in the Sutra Requested by Akṣayamati, ‘One can overlook the maintenance of moral conduct at the time of giving’.9 This applies to minor attendant misdeeds, but not to inherent misdeeds or downfalls. 
>>> Whatever I have intended to do, I should undertake it
>>> And not change my mind about it.
>>> With my mind committed like this,
>>> It will be accomplished in due course.
>>> ‘Why should one overlook a more important practice—moral conduct—to practise giving?’
>>> Whatever is most important, that is what should be practised. In this context, once something has been undertaken, it becomes more important.
>>> I will carry out everything to completion in this way,
>>> Or nothing else will get done either.
>>> I will not lose clear comprehension
>>> Nor increase the secondary defilements because of this.
>>> Since it is a time when one has a dispensation, there is no fault of lacking clear comprehension and no fault will occur due to one’s relaxation because the intention to overlook moral conduct10 is not a giving up of the mind of abandonment. 
>>> When I come across
>>> The various kinds of senseless chatter
>>> And the many impressive entertainments, 
>>> I should abandon my attachment to them.
>>> When I meaninglessly gouge at the earth,
>>> Pick at the grass or draw lines on the ground,
>>> Then, remembering the Tathāgata’s training,
>>> I will concernedly stop right away. 
>>> When I think of moving or 
>>> When I think of speaking,
>>> Having first examined my mind,
>>> I should, with deliberateness, act appropriately.
>>> When my mind is desirous or angry 
>>> And I want to react, at that time,
>>> I should not react and should not say anything.
>>> Rather, I should remain like a block of wood.
>>> When my attitude is irritated or derisive,
>>> Proud, vain,
>>> Cruel or deceptive,
>>> When I am seeking praise
>>> Or criticizing someone,
>>> Insulting them or picking a fight,
>>> At such times, I should remain like a block of wood.
>>> When I want to profit, be respected and recognized,
>>> When I want to have subordinates,
>>> Or when I think I should be attended to—
>>> At such times, I should remain like a block of wood.
>>> When I want to give up benefitting others
>>> To pursue my own benefit,
>>> Or when I am about to speak out,
>>> Then I should remain like a block of wood.
>>> When I am about to be impatient, lazy, afraid,
>>> Rude, stupid, 
>>> Or preferential to my own side,
>>> That is when I should remain like a block of wood.
>>> Thus, having examined those motivations which are based on the defilements or are neutral, one can abandon them. 
>>> Examining the mind in this way for defilements
>>> And meaningless aims,
>>> The heroic one should hold the mind firmly
>>> With the antidotes.
>>> Fully resolved, with proper faith,
>>> Steadfast, respectful, polite, 
>>> With care and apprehension,
>>> And with calmness, I will strive for the happiness of others.
>>> ‘Fully resolved’ means firmly applying oneself or distinguishing what to accept and reject. ‘Proper faith’ means the three kinds of faith. ‘Steadfast’ means not retreating from the antidotes. ‘Respectful’ means regarding one’s respect and service of the Three Jewels as of great importance. ‘Polite’ means addressing impartially the old, the middle-aged and the young with courteous words. ‘Care’ means avoiding nonvirtues, whether inherent misdeeds or due to the power of dharma [i.e. attendant misdeeds]. ‘Apprehension’ means fearing the ripening of karma. ‘Calmness’ means the senses are disciplined. ‘Striving for the happiness of others’ means acting with great concern for the benefit of others. 
>>> Undiscouraged by the inclinations
>>> Of bickering, childish people,
>>> I will think kindly that they are like this
>>> Because of the defilements arising in their minds.
>>> ‘The inclinations of bickering, childish people’ means those whose intentions are in conflict. One should not be discouraged by them. The antidote to such discouragement is kind affection, indicated in the last two lines.
>>> Without propagating misdeeds,
>>> Whether acting for myself or for sentient beings,
>>> I will always keep this attitude,
>>> Acting selflessly, like an apparition.
>>> Thinking again and again
>>> That finally I have attained this supreme freedom,
>>> I will hold on to this mind and it will stray
>>> No more than the king of mountains.
>>> 1.	Accomplishing non-attachment to the body
>>> 1. Accomplishing non-attachment to the body
>>> Though vultures, wanting flesh,
>>> Will fight to tear it apart,
>>> That does not bother you, mind.
>>> So why cherish it so much now?
>>> Having taken this body as ‘mine’,
>>> Why, mind, are you so protective of it?
>>> For if it is really separate from you,
>>> What good is it to you anyway?
>>> Why, my defiled mind,
>>> Don’t you instead take a nice, clean block of wood?
>>> Wouldn’t that be better than trying to look after
>>> This contraption, which is a pile of filth, falling apart?
>>> First of all, in my mind, 
>>> I distinguish the layers of skin.
>>> Then, with the scalpel of discrimination,
>>> I separate the flesh from the skeleton.
>>> Having analysed the bones as well,
>>> Until I see their very marrow,
>>> I look and ask myself,
>>> ‘Where is the essence in this?’
>>> If, in such a determined search,
>>> I can see no essence,
>>> Why go on protecting 
>>> This body with such attachment?
>>> If you cannot eat this impure body,
>>> Nor drink its blood,
>>> Nor chew on its offal,
>>> What actual use is it to you?
>>> On the other hand, it is alright to look after it
>>> So that the jackals and vultures have something to eat.
>>> ‘On the other hand’ indicates what happens if one does look after it.
>>> These human bodies of ours
>>> Should be used only in service.
>>> In this way, even if you do look after it,
>>> When the unsentimental Lord of Death
>>> Seizes it and gives it to the birds and dogs,
>>> What will you do then?
>>> If you don’t give clothes, etc. 
>>> To servants who will not work for them,
>>> Why do you reward this body,
>>> Which you are going to lose no matter what you feed it?
>>> I have already paid the body its wages,
>>> So now it must start working for me.
>>> If it is of no use,
>>> It should not be given anything.
>>> On account of its coming and going,
>>> I will think of the body as a boat.
>>> In order to accomplish the benefit of beings,
>>> I will transform it into a wish fulfilling body.
>>> While there is the freedom to do this,
>>> Always presenting a cheerful countenance, 
>>> I will stop scowling angrily
>>> And, instead, be a straightforward friend to the world. 
>>> I will cease moving my seat around, etc.
>>> In an inconsiderate or noisy way,
>>> And cease slamming doors,
>>> Always enjoying quietness.
>>> Cranes, cats and thieves
>>> Move silently and undetected
>>> And evidently get what they want.
>>> The wise should always behave like they do.
>>> By accepting respectfully and with gratitude
>>> The unsolicited and beneficial words of others
>>> That admonish or advise me,
>>> I will always be the pupil of everyone.
>>> For all that is well-said,
>>> I should call it virtuous.
>>> When I see something meritorious being done,
>>> I will praise it and take delight in it.
>>> One should praise it with words and be delighted in one’s mind.
>>> I should describe good qualities that are hidden,
>>> And I should confirm good qualities that are expressed.
>>> If my own good qualities are mentioned,
>>> I should notice that those good qualities were recognized.
>>> The first line indicates not disputing descriptions of others’ good qualities, while the second line indicates giving confirmation of descriptions of others’ good qualities. The last two lines indicate giving up conceit when one’s own good qualities are described.
>>> Everything we do should be for the sake of joy,
>>> But joy is difficult to buy, even for the wealthy.
>>> So, I will be happy when joy
>>> Is brought about by the good qualities of others.
>>> It will cost me nothing now,
>>> And in future lives it will bring great bliss.
>>> Otherwise I will have no joy and only suffering,
>>> And in future lives I will have even greater suffering.
>>> The first two lines indicate establishing the benefit of others. The next two lines indicate one’s developing of joy in that benefit. The next two lines indicate the good qualities of developing joy for others. The last two lines indicate the faults of not having joy. [314]
>>> When speaking, my speech should be
>>> Authentic, consistent, clear, pleasant,
>>> Without attachment or aversion,
>>> Gentle and appropriate. 
>>> ‘Authentic’ means having sincerity. ‘Consistent’ means what is said later should not contradict what was said before. ‘Clear’ means not being obscure. ‘Pleasant’ means pleasing. ‘Without attachment or aversion’ means having a virtuous intent. ‘Gentle’ means not being aggressive. ‘Appropriate’ means speaking at the right times. 
>>> When my eyes see someone,
>>> Thinking, ‘I can attain buddhahood itself
>>> In dependence upon this very person’,
>>> I will look at them directly and with a gentle regard.
>>> ‘When my eyes see someone’ is the establishing condition. ‘Gentle’ means pleasing.
>>> Always motivated by aspiration 
>>> Or antidotes,
>>> There will be great virtue
>>> In the fields of good qualities, help and suffering.
>>> The field of ‘good qualities’ is the Three Jewels, etc. The field of ‘help’ is parents, abbots and ācāryas. The field of ‘suffering’ is the poor, etc.

>>> 1. Increasing activities for the benefit of others
>>> With this in mind, I should always
>>> Keep working to benefit others.
>>> For this, the far-seeing Compassionate One
>>> Permitted what is otherwise forbidden.
>>> The most important thing is the benefit of others. [315] Can one become tainted by downfalls through this? No, since what is forbidden for śrāvakas is permitted for those whose principal intention is to benefit others. Who permitted this? It was permitted by the Buddha, whose intentions are compassionate and whose understanding is far-seeing, i.e. he perceives that which is extremely distant.
>>> Though otherwise forbidden, it is permitted
>>> For the compassionate one who sees far.
>>> To whom is this permitted? To one whose intention is compassionate, i.e. whose objective is to benefit others, and who is far-seeing.
>>> Apart from consuming just enough food
>>> And wearing the three dharma robes, I will donate the rest
>>> To those who have fallen, those with no protector
>>> And those maintaining discipline.
>>> The recipients: ‘those who have fallen’—hungry ghosts, hell beings etc.—‘those with no protector’—the poor—and ‘those maintaining discipline’—friends observing monastic rules. The substances: consuming in moderation food acquired though begging alms and donating the rest and wearing only the three dharma robes and donating the rest.
>>> A body being used to practise the holy dharma
>>> Should not be harmed for the sake of something trivial.
>>> If I act in this way, the wishes of beings
>>> Will be fulfilled more quickly.
>>> My compassionate intentions being impure,
>>> I should not give away this body but,
>>> In this and future lives,
>>> It may be given to accomplish a great benefit.
>>> The dharma should not be explained to the disrespectful:
>>> Those wrapping their heads in cloth like sick men,
>>> Those carrying parasols, sticks, or weapons,
>>> And those covering their heads.
>>> The profound and vast should not be taught to the lesser,
>>> Nor to an unaccompanied woman.
>>> I should always show equal respect
>>> To the lesser and supreme teachings.
>>> I should not impart the lesser teachings
>>> To a vessel of the vast teachings.
>>> I should not abandon the conduct.
>>> I should not mislead others with sutras or mantras.
>>> ‘Equal’ means holding all the teachings equally and ‘respect’ means holding them in the highest regard. Lines 90ab indicate matching the vessel and the teaching. 90c is a reference to the supreme path of conduct. 90d indicates not subverting the teachings, such as denying that they teach a connection between actions and effects.
>>> When cleaning my teeth or spitting,
>>> I should discreetly dispose of it.
>>> To urinate, etc. in water
>>> Or places used by others is disgusting.
>>> I should not eat noisily or with my mouth open,
>>> Or by cramming my mouth full.
>>> I should not sit with my feet up
>>> Or massage my shoulders with both hands at once.16
>>> I should not be alone with a woman
>>> When travelling, sleeping or staying somewhere.

>>> I should never indicate by finger-pointing
>>> But politely gesture towards things
>>> With my right hand open.
>>> This is also how I should show which way to go.
>>> I should not gesticulate wildly,
>>> But express my point with slight movements,
>>> Signalling with a click of the fingers, etc.
>>> To do otherwise would be rude.
>>> I should sleep like the Protector passing into nirvāṇa—
>>> Lying in the preferred direction.
>>> With clear comprehension, I should resolve
>>> To promptly rise early in the morning.
>>> In summary, practise the conduct which purifies the mind:
>>> Though it is taught 
>>> That bodhisattva conduct is limitless,
>>> For now, I should actually practise 
>>> As much conduct as possible that purifies the mind.
>>> Three times each day and night,
>>> I should recite the Sutra of the Three Heaps and
>>> Pacify the residual downfalls
>>> By relying upon the conquerors and bodhicitta.
>>> The three heaps are confession of nonvirtues, rejoicing and dedication.17 These skilful means for swiftly attaining perfect enlightenment can be used to confess downfalls. ‘Residual downfalls’ means accompanying negativities released by confession, i.e. even if one’s moral conduct is restored, the unripened karmic potential of the former downfall may remain. The three heaps will pacify that. [317] It says in the Sutra of the Great Lion’s Roar of Maitreya,
>>> Because one should exhaust nonvirtues previously committed, one should recite the dharma liturgy of the Three Heaps. If one does so, though there are remnant downfalls, one confesses the faults. Merely by doing so, they are purified and henceforth one will not break the vows.18 
>>> Regardless of whether it is one’s own or another’s [training],
>>> For any particular situation,

>>> In whatever is taught for that situation.
>>> There is nothing that
>>> The sons of the conquerors fail to train in.
>>> For the wise, who always keep to this,
>>> Nothing will fail to be meritorious. 
>>> Whether directly or indirectly,

>>> ‘So that this may only benefit beings,
>>> I dedicate it all to enlightenment.’

>>> Learned in the Mahāyāna
>>> And has mastered the discipline of the bodhisattvas.
>>> I should never discard him, even at the cost of my life.
>>> I should train in relying upon the teacher
>>> As in the chapter of Śrisambhava.
>>> This and the other instructions given by the Buddha
>>> I should understand through reading the sutras.
>>> ‘This’ means the bodhisattva trainings. The ‘other instructions given by the Buddha’ means the śrāvaka trainings and so forth. One should gradually learn these:
>>> The trainings are found in the sutras,
>>> So I should read the sutras.
>>> The Ākāśagarbha Sutra
>>> Is the one I should look at first.
>>> Because what is always to be practised
>>> Is taught there very extensively,
>>> I will be certain to also study
>>> The Śikṣā-samuccaya.
>>> Otherwise I should study
>>> The Sutra-samuccaya.
>>> I should also make an effort to study
>>> These two works composed by Ārya Nāgārjuna.
>>> The Ākāśagarbha Sutra explains the root downfalls.22 The two Samuccayas23 give a general account of the main body of training.
>>> I should practise whatever is not
>>> Prohibited there.
>>> In order to protect worldly minds
>>> I should fully practise what I have learnt.
>>> I should examine again and again
>>> The conditions of body and mind.
>>> This alone encapsulates
>>> The key point of maintaining clear comprehension.
>>> I should put this into practice,
>>> For what use are mere words?
>>> Are sicknesses cured
>>> Just by reading about the treatment?
>>> 2. The ‘women’ here are explained by other commentators including Prajñākaramati (W21708, p. 104) and Thokme Zangpo (W1KG1795, p. 64) to be denizens of the Śālmari (or Śālmali) hell, who entice one into tortures, manifesting as the result of sexual misconduct. Lhopa Rinchen Pal (p. 95) glosses the point as ‘one’s own nonvirtues are the appearances of mind’ and gives a quote from the same sutra: 
>>> See also Śāntideva’s reference to this in The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, pp. 240-241.
>>> 10. The text has giving (sbyin pa) here, but presumably the intent is to match v5.42d. Lhopa Rinchen Pal, on this same point, has moral conduct (p. 99).
>>> 22. As noted above, these are also quoted in full by Śāntideva in chapter four of the Śikṣā-samuccaya. See The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, pp. 63-68.
>>> 23. This refers to the Śikṣā-samuccaya and the Sutra-samuccaya of Śāntideva and two works of the same titles by Nāgārjuna, of which only Śāntideva’s Śikṣā-samuccaya (D3940) and Nāgārjuna’s Sutra-samucaya (D3934) are extant.
>>> Chapter 6: Patience
>>> 1.	Developing motivation for patience [v1-6]
>>> 1. Developing motivation for patience
>>> All those good actions 
>>> Like giving and making offerings to the Sugatas,
>>> Accumulated over a thousand aeons,
>>> Are destroyed in an instant of anger.
>>> ‘Giving and making offerings to the Sugatas’ means that giving itself is distinguished according to its recipients, which are of the inferior and superior fields. ‘Like’ means that what arises from moral discipline [319] and from meditation are also included. ‘Good actions’ means those that were meritorious but were not dedicated to liberation. ‘Anger’ means an aggressive attitude. ‘Destroyed’ means that since one is reborn into the lower realms in the next life as the result of anger, the possibility of all one’s good actions ripening into experience is destroyed. 
>>> There is no nonvirtue like anger,
>>> And no austerity like patience.
>>> Therefore, in the various ways,
>>> I should persevere in developing patience.
>>> 2.	Harm to the body
>>> If I hold onto thoughts afflicted by anger,
>>> My mind will know no peace.
>>> Having no happiness or pleasure,
>>> I will be unsettled and unable to sleep.
>>> 2. Harm to the body
>>> Some may depend on his favour
>>> For wealth and status,
>>> But even they will turn against
>>> A hateful master and kill him.
>>> Friends and relatives will become fed up with him and,
>>> Though drawn by his generosity, will not want to be around him.
>>> ‘Status’ means to be served food and so forth. Such people will turn against an angry master and will kill him. Those who are his friends and relatives will not want to be around him, even though they are attracted by his giving.
>>> In short, someone who stays angry
>>> Will never be happy.
>>> It is the enemy, anger, which creates
>>> Sufferings like these.
>>> But whoever takes control and destroys anger
>>> Will be happy in this life and future lives.
>>> It arises in the production of what I wish against,
>>> And in the obstruction of what I wish for.
>>> Feeding on an unhappy mind,
>>> Aggression grows and destroys me.
>>> Therefore, I should completely eliminate
>>> The sustenance of this enemy—
>>> An enemy which does nothing
>>> But harm me.
>>> Whatever may befall me,
>>> My joyful disposition will not be disturbed.
>>> Being unhappy won’t accomplish any of my wishes
>>> And my virtues will only deteriorate.
>>> If something can be done,
>>> What’s the point of being unhappy?
>>> If nothing can be done,
>>> What good is it to be unhappy?
>>> For myself and my friends, 
>>> I want no suffering, no disrespect,
>>> No criticism and nothing unpleasant.
>>> For my enemies, I want the opposite.
>>> In addition, there are obstructions to the twelve desirables, i.e. twenty-four undesirables in total. Concerning friends of enemies, if they make one unhappy and cause harm, they are essentially the same as enemies, whereas if they bring benefit and happiness, they are essentially friends. If they bring neither benefit nor harm, since they are objects neither of attachment or aversion, they are not determined one way or the other.
>>> 2.	Stopping impatience with the production of negative actions towards one’s own side
>>> While the causes of happiness are few,
>>> The causes of suffering are many.
>>> Without suffering, there is no renunciation.
>>> Therefore, mind, remain steady.
>>> The devotees of Gaurī and the practitioners of Karna
>>> Undergo burns, cuts and so forth,
>>> Enduring them patiently for no benefit. Yet, for the sake
>>> Of liberation, why do I have no courage?
>>> There is nothing that does not
>>> Become easier with habituation.
>>> Therefore, by habituation to small difficulties,
>>> I will have the patience for great difficulties.
>>> Who has not undergone the pointless sufferings
>>> Of snake or insect bites,
>>> Experiences of hunger and thirst,
>>> And afflictions like skin inflammations?
>>> I should not be so sensitive 
>>> To heat, cold, rain, wind and so forth,
>>> To sickness, confinement, blows and so forth—
>>> Because that only magnifies their harm.
>>> Some, when they see their own blood,
>>> Develop even greater courage and resolve.
>>> Some, when they see the blood of another,
>>> Feel faint and fall unconscious.
>>> These come from having a stable
>>> Or a weak state of mind.
>>> Therefore, disregarding harm,
>>> I will be unaffected by suffering.
>>> Even when suffering occurs,
>>> The wise should not let it disturb their peace of mind.
>>> In battles with the defilements
>>> There will be many injuries.
>>> Having disregarded all sufferings,
>>> Enemies like aggression will be overcome.
>>> Those who do so are the real conquering heroes—
>>> The rest are just butchering corpses.
>>> Furthermore, suffering has good qualities:
>>> Sadness dispels arrogance,
>>> One feels compassion for those in saṃsāra,
>>> Avoids nonvirtue and delights in virtue.
>>> The four points here are that pride, the cause of suffering, is destroyed (first two lines), one has the courage to benefit others (third line), the causes of suffering are dispelled (first half of last line) and one pursues the causes of happiness (second half of last line). 
>>> I have no anger towards things like bile,
>>> Though they can be great sources of suffering,
>>> So why be angry with those which have a mind?
>>> They are all just responding to conditions.
>>> Though they are unwanted,
>>> Such sicknesses nevertheless occur.
>>> Similarly, though they are unwanted,
>>> Defilements stubbornly arise. 
>>> They don’t think, ‘I’m going to get angry now’,
>>> But people nevertheless get angry.
>>> Similarly, it doesn’t think ‘I’m going to arise now’,
>>> But anger nevertheless arises.
>>> All the various negative actions 
>>> And all the many kinds of nonvirtue
>>> Arise through the power of conditions.
>>> They are not autonomous.
>>> Though there is a coming together of conditions,
>>> There is no thought of, ‘I’m going to arise now.’
>>> Nor does that which is produced
>>> Have any thought of itself as produced.
>>> 1.	Refuting the position of the Sāṃkhyas
>>> 1. Refuting the position of the Sāṃkhyas
>>> Some claim that there is a primal substance,
>>> [Objection:] ‘That which depends upon external conditions has no autonomy. However, we postulate a primal substance and individual consciousnesses2 that are sempiternal and arise by their own power without dependence upon conditions. When the three material natures that comprise the primal substance are in disequilibrium, its universal flow displays manifestations,3 all of which are pervaded by the oneness of the primal substance.’
>>> And they designate a ‘self’,
>>> 3.	The five bare elements
>>> ‘In the mirror of mind, happiness and so forth—the manifesting nature of the five bare elements—are resting passively. The selves—cognizing awarenesses—are also resting passively. When these two factors connect, objects arise as experiences of benefit and harm to the self. The primal nature and its manifestations are ultimately one, arising in themselves, though the primal nature is sempiternal while the manifestations are temporary. Therefore, an individual consciousness creates harm autonomously by engaging in aggressive actions such as attacking an enemy.’6
>>> But it does not deliberately think,
>>> ‘I will arise now’, and then arise,
>>> And if that which has not arisen does not yet exist,
>>> What in that moment wants to create itself?
>>> [Proof:] The logical subject is the moment when the manifestation has not yet arisen. The probandum is indicated in the second line, i.e. that there is no premeditating intention at that time. The reason is indicated in the first line, i.e. because a wish to create itself cannot exist before the manifestation has arisen. Therefore, since there is no premeditating intention before the manifestation has arisen, the manifestation itself is not an autonomous creator. 
>>> Since it would immutably attend to its object,
>>> It would never cease.
>>> Furthermore, if the self is sempiternal,
>>> Like space, it is clearly not an agent.
>>> Even if it encountered extraneous conditions,
>>> Being immutable, what could it do?
>>> The logical subject is the self which is designated as ‘immutable’. [326] The probandum is indicated by, ‘Even if it encountered extraneous conditions, what could it do?’ i.e. it could not begin to do something which it was not previously doing. The reason: ‘Because it is immutable.’ The pervader is not supported.12 To establish the qualification for that:13
>>> During creation, if it is as it was previously,
>>> In what sense did it create the thing?
>>> ‘Although, being sempiternal, the self does not change, it can change only in the sense that it has the ability [to produce harm] under the right conditions. In this sense, it produces a result but in another sense it does not produce the result.’
>>> ‘It was produced due to this [condition].’
>>> Then what relation does the self have to the product? 
>>> In this way, everything is extraneously controlled,
>>> And not even the controllers have any power.
>>> When this is recognized, I will not get angry
>>> At things which are like apparitions.
>>> Some claim that there is a primal substance,
>>> And they designate a ‘self’.
>>> 1. Refuting the position of the Sāṃkhyas
>>> 1.	Refuting the primal substance as creator
>>> 1. Refuting the primal substance as creator
>>> But it does not deliberately think,
>>> ‘I will arise now’, and then arise,
>>> ‘The primal substance is not the creator; the manifestations are the creator.’
>>> And if that which has not arisen does not exist,
>>> What in that moment wants to create itself?
>>> [327] The state in which the manifestations have not arisen is the logical subject. ‘What wants to create itself’ indicates that there is no mind to think ‘I want to create myself’. ‘If it does not exist’ indicates [the reason]: because it has no nature before it has arisen.
>>> Since it would immutably attend to its object,
>>> It would never cease.
>>> The individual consciousness is the logical subject. It follows that it would never cease because of ‘immutably attending to its object’, i.e. its experience is sempiternal. Since objects and experiences are temporary, this position is to be rejected. Therefore, because objects and experiences are temporary, one must accept their creator [i.e. individual consciousness] is not sempiternal. The contrary pervader is supported,17 i.e. it is proven that this is incompatible with an individual consciousness.
>>> ‘Who prevents what?
>>> It is inappropriate to prevent anything.’
>>> Through reliance on this, the stream
>>> Of suffering will be cut—there is nothing wrong with this.
>>> Therefore, regardless of friend or enemy,
>>> When I see them behaving negatively,
>>> Thinking, ‘This comes from related conditions’,
>>> I will remain happy.
>>> If it were true that we could achieve whatever we wanted,
>>> Then, since among all living beings,
>>> Nobody wants to suffer,
>>> There would never be any suffering.
>>> 3. The patience of not thinking of them as the cause of harm
>>> 3.	Examination of one’s own faults
>>> Those who lack concern cause harm
>>> Even to themselves, with weapons, etc.
>>> And for the sake of what they might attain, such as women,
>>> They go hungry, refuse food and so on.
>>> Some, by hanging themselves, jumping off precipices,
>>> Taking poisonous or harmful food,
>>> Or by unmeritorious actions,
>>> Do harm to themselves.
>>> It is not illogical that they would cause harm to others:
>>> When the defilements are in control,
>>> Even the precious self can be killed.
>>> How, then, could they not 
>>> Do harm to the bodies of others?
>>> Even if I do not develop vast compassion
>>> For those who, driven by defilements,
>>> Resort to killing themselves and so forth in such ways,
>>> How can I become angry?
>>> Anger towards an intrinsic nature is wrong: 
>>> If it is in the nature of fools
>>> To cause harm to others,
>>> Then it is wrong to be angry with them:
>>> That is like getting angry with a flame for having the nature to burn.
>>> On the other hand, if their faults are accidental,
>>> Occurring despite their intrinsic nature,
>>> Then it is wrong to be angry with them:
>>> That is like getting angry with an empty space for the presence of a cloud of incense. 
>>> It is their weapons and so forth that are the direct instruments of harm,
>>> So when I get angry with someone who strikes me,
>>> It would make more sense to be angry with their aggression,
>>> Since they are themselves driven by aggression.
>>> 3. Examination of one’s own faults
>>> 1.	The faults are one’s own
>>> 3.	The fault of attachment, which causes suffering
>>> 4.	The fault of activities which are of no benefit to others
>>> 5.	The angry mind has it the wrong way round
>>> 1. The faults are one’s own
>>> Previously, I caused sentient beings
>>> Some similar kind of harm.
>>> Therefore, it is only right that harm should come
>>> To me, a doer of harm to sentient beings.
>>> His weapon and my own body
>>> Jointly caused this suffering.
>>> He drew the weapon, I brought the body:
>>> Which of these should I be angry with?
>>> The human form is like an abscess:
>>> It is unbearably sensitive and painful.
>>> If, blinded by craving, I cling to it,
>>> Who should I be angry with when I am harmed?
>>> 3. The fault of attachment, which causes suffering [329]
>>> If a fool does not want to suffer
>>> But, nevertheless, is attached to its causes,
>>> It is his own negative actions that are harming him,
>>> So why fall out with others?
>>> It is like, for example, how the guardians of hell
>>> Or the forest of razor leaves
>>> Come from my own actions.
>>> That, then, is who I should be angry with.
>>> 4. The fault of activities which are of no benefit to others
>>> Provoked by my own actions,
>>> Beings come to harm me
>>> But, in doing so, they fall into the hells.
>>> Is it not I who am destroying them?
>>> By the cause—one’s own negative actions, others have become involved in doing harm to oneself. Thus, one has involved them in the causes of rebirth in the lower realms.
>>> 5. The angry mind has it the wrong way round
>>> In dependence upon them,
>>> With patience, many nonvirtues are purified,
>>> But in dependence upon me,
>>> They fall into the hells for a long time.
>>> So if I am doing harm to them
>>> But they are bringing benefit to me,
>>> Do I not have it the wrong way round?
>>> It is wrong of you, mind, to be angry.
>>> If someone harms himself but benefits oneself, one would not feel anger towards that person. Since he is  benefitting oneself, why would one feel anger? That would be to have it the wrong way around. How does he benefit oneself? Many of one’s own nonvirtues are purified in dependence upon him. By what essential cause? By patience: since he is helping one practise patience and helping purify one’s nonvirtues, he is benefitting oneself. How is one doing harm to him? Since the enemy’s harm is directed towards oneself, it is in dependence upon oneself that he is reborn as a hell-being for such a long time.
>>> ‘Since they will be going to a rebirth in the lower realms through me, I am supporting the nonvirtues of others. I cannot both support their nonvirtues and purify my own nonvirtues. Therefore, if I am not purifying my own nonvirtues, how can you say that their nonvirtues benefit me by supporting the purification of my own nonvirtues?’ 
>>> If I have the right attitude,
>>> I will not go to the hells.
>>> Although the nonvirtues of others are conditional upon oneself, one’s own nonvirtues will be purified and one will not be reborn in hell because of this. 
>>> Because of having the right attitude, i.e. patience. Therefore, when one’s own nonvirtues are purified, it is established that others are the beneficial supports of that.
>>> But if I only look after myself,
>>> What does this do for them?
>>> If one has a benevolent attitude, thinking, ‘They are supporting my practice of virtue’, what does this do for them? It does nothing for them. Therefore, since they will still go to the hells, it is not contradictory that one harms them, since oneself is the condition of their going there.
>>> It is ‘if I only look after myself’, i.e. while they can support both nonvirtue and virtue, if one protects one’s own mind from nonvirtue with patience, then they are supporting only the virtue.
>>> However, if I return their harm,
>>> That will not protect them either,
>>> But it would damage my conduct,
>>> And so destroy the discipline.
>>> It would not support virtue for someone with the right attitude [patience] to actively harm others. Rather, one would be supporting nonvirtue. Rather than protect them, since one’s own conduct would be damaged, one’s discipline would be destroyed. 
>>> 1.	It does no harm to the body
>>> 1. It does no harm to the body [331]
>>> Since the mind lacks physical form,
>>> What could destroy it?
>>> It is by attachment to the body
>>> That I am harmed by physical suffering.
>>> If disrespectful words, 
>>> Harsh speech and criticism
>>> Cannot harm the body,
>>> Why, mind, do you fly into a rage?
>>> If contempt from others
>>> Will not, in this life or future lives,
>>> Destroy me,
>>> Why am I so averse to it?
>>> I am averse to something
>>> Because it hinders acquisition,
>>> But the acquisitions of this life will be lost,
>>> While the nonvirtues will firmly remain.
>>> It would be better to die today
>>> Than to live a long life badly,
>>> For although someone like me might be around for a long time,
>>> The suffering of death still awaits.
>>> Even though one may live a long life, the suffering of death cannot be avoided. 
>>> Someone wakes from a dream
>>> Of having a hundred years of happiness,
>>> Having dreamt he had just a moment of happiness.
>>> Though they have both awoken,
>>> The happiness of neither one will return.
>>> No matter whether life is long or short,
>>> At the moment of death, it is exhausted just the same.
>>> Whether life is long or short, it ends in death. At that time, the happiness one had when alive will be just a memory. 
>>> Though I may have gotten many acquisitions
>>> And enjoyed happiness for a long time,
>>> I will nevertheless go forth naked and empty-handed,
>>> As if robbers had left me that way.
>>> ‘But can’t I live off these acquisitions,
>>> Exhausting nonvirtue and gathering merit?’
>>> If I get angry over acquisitions,
>>> Won’t that merit be exhausted in nonvirtue?
>>> What am I living for
>>> If I am violating the very point of life?
>>> Where is the meaning in living a life
>>> In which there is only nonvirtue?
>>> ‘It is because of the damage they do
>>> By criticizing me that I get angry with beings.’
>>> Then why do you not get angry like this
>>> When they are criticizing others?
>>> And yet, when those same people criticize someone else, causing others to lose respect for him, it follows that you should also become angry with them.
>>> You are patient with a loss of respect
>>> When it depends on someone else,
>>> So why not be patient with criticisms,
>>> Since they are dependent upon the arising of the defilements.
>>> 2.	The patience of putting up with harm-doers
>>> Although they may disparage or destroy
>>> Statues, stupas or the holy dharma,
>>> It is wrong for me to be angry,
>>> For they have no power to harm the Buddhas and so forth.
>>> They may even harm my teachers,
>>> Friends or relatives but,
>>> Seeing these things arise from conditions,
>>> As explained above, anger will be averted.
>>> 2. The patience of putting up with harm-doers
>>> 3.	Examining one’s own faults
>>> If bodies with minds 
>>> And bodies without minds both do harm,
>>> Why be angry only at those with minds?
>>> I should be patient with their harm either way.
>>> One gets angry with enemies who have a mind, like those who harm one’s own side, so why not get angry with something mindless like bile?
>>> If someone out of delusion does something wrong
>>> And someone else out of delusion gets angry,
>>> Which of them is without fault,
>>> And which of them is at fault?
>>> To practise negative actions out of delusion means harming one’s side due to not understanding the ripening of actions. To become angry out of delusion means the anger is due to not understanding the faults of aggression. It is inappropriate for both of them to become angry.
>>> 3. Examining one’s own faults
>>> Why did I previously commit actions
>>> That make others harm me?
>>> If it all comes down to my own actions,
>>> Why get mad at others?
>>> Looking at it this way,
>>> I should concentrate on increasing merit
>>> And bringing about an attitude 
>>> Of mutual love between everyone.
>>> 3.	Great benefit will be achieved
>>> For example, when a fire consumes a house,
>>> Before it spreads to another house,
>>> One removes from it inflammables 
>>> Such as dry straw and so forth.
>>> Similarly, if the mind is attached to something,
>>> The fire of aggression will spread there,
>>> So I should remove it right now
>>> Out of fear that merit will be consumed.
>>> Isn’t it better for a man to be freed with his hand chopped off 
>>> Than for him to be executed?
>>> Isn’t it better, then, to experience human suffering
>>> If it spares me from the hells?
>>> If I am unable now to bear 
>>> Even these slight sufferings,
>>> Why do I not avert anger,
>>> The cause of the sufferings of hell?
>>> Like someone who receives the punishment of a severed limb and is freed from the punishment of execution, similarly, when human sufferings ripen, freeing one from the sufferings of the hells, it is a good thing. Yet, if one cannot bear even comparatively minor human suffering, what can be said about the sufferings of the hells, which are very great?
>>> 3. Great benefit will be achieved
>>> Out of desire, I have undergone burning and so forth 
>>> In the hells, thousands upon thousands of times,
>>> Without it doing anything meaningful for me
>>> Or anything meaningful for others.
>>> Now, great benefit can be achieved
>>> For a harm that is not even a tiny fraction of that.
>>> I should only be joyful
>>> In sufferings that dispel the harms of beings.
>>> If others take pleasure in
>>> Praising someone’s good qualities,
>>> Why, mind, do you find no joy 
>>> In praising them?
>>> The pleasure you would have
>>> Would not infringe your vows but bring you happiness.
>>> It is permitted by excellent ones,
>>> And is the supreme gathering of others.
>>> When one’s enemies are made joyful by praising others, one should also praise them oneself, adding to their joy because the pleasure of benefitting others is a source of happiness, not a negative action and because it is extolled by the learned and accomplishes the benefit of others. In short, it is as joyful to join in with someone else’s praise of another as when others praise oneself. So, it is right that one should also take joy in that.
>>> ‘But only others would have that happiness.’
>>> If the happiness of others does not matter to you,
>>> The visible and invisible will be lost,
>>> Because of not paying them their wages and so forth.
>>> If one never cared about the happiness of others, since one would abandon paying them wages, the benefits of this life would be lost—the loss of visible dharmas—and one would abandon giving and so forth—the loss of the invisible results. 
>>> The happiness of others is the cause of one’s own happiness and if that cause does not exist, the result—one’s own happiness—will not arise. [335] Therefore, work for the result by taking joy in the causes of others’ happiness without taking joy in the causes of one’s own happiness. Otherwise one will be endeavouring in the wrong causes:
>>> When they are describing my good qualities,
>>> That’s when I want them to be happy, too,
>>> But, when they are describing someone else’s good qualities,
>>> That’s when their happiness doesn’t matter.
>>> Having generated bodhicitta
>>> By wishing for the happiness of all sentient beings,
>>> Why do I get angry
>>> When beings find happiness by themselves?
>>> If I am claiming to want sentient beings to be 
>>> Enlightened objects of veneration in the three worlds,
>>> Why, seeing them receive just some basic respect,
>>> Am I aghast at the sight of it?
>>> If your relative who needs looking after,
>>> And who relies on what you can provide for him,
>>> Becomes able to look after himself,
>>> Wouldn’t this make you joyful? Or would you get angry with him?
>>> Why would someone want enlightenment 
>>> If they do not want what is best for beings?
>>> How can someone have bodhicitta
>>> Who gets angry with the acquisitions of others?
>>> Regardless of whether he gets the thing
>>> Or it stays in the donor’s house,
>>> Either way, you won’t get it,
>>> So what does it matter whether it is given away or not?
>>> Why did I reject merit, 
>>> Faith and good qualities?
>>> Tell me why I am not angry with the one 
>>> Who did not take the opportunities for acquisitions?
>>> These two verses indicate, respectively, that it is equally of no use to oneself whether others get acquisitions or not and that it is one’s own fault if one does not have acquisitions. ‘Merit’ means the accumulated actions of giving to others over a succession of lives. ‘Faith’ in this sense means practising giving, the skilful means of faithful people. ‘Good qualities’ means moral conduct and so forth. Why did one reject these in one’s former lives? Therefore, as someone who rejected these in former lives, why compare oneself—someone bearing the faults of their own past nonvirtues—with others? 
>>> Not only are you not worried
>>> About your own nonvirtues,
>>> Do you also want to compete
>>> With others who have gathered merit?
>>> Even if an enemy is unhappy,
>>> What in that brings you happiness?
>>> Your merely hoping for it
>>> Cannot be a cause of his harm.
>>> Even if your wishes could bring him suffering, 
>>> What happiness is in it for you?
>>> ‘I would be satisfied.’
>>> Could anything be more destructive than that?
>>> The first two lines indicate that harm to others is of no use as an object of happiness for oneself. The second two lines indicate that the subjective malevolent mind does not harm others.20 The second verse indicates that one’s subjective malevolent mind harms oneself. One’s destruction by the creation of suffering for others means that one will be reborn in the lower realms. Why?
>>> Those caught painfully on this sharp hook,
>>> Cast by the angling defilements,
>>> Will be cooked in the pots
>>> Of the guardians of hell.
>>> The prestige of praise and reputation
>>> Will bring no merit, nor extend my life,
>>> Will not make me stronger, nor free me from sickness,
>>> Nor will it bring any physical pleasure.
>>> If I care about what is good for me,
>>> I should ask what use these things are.
>>> ‘Merit’ is beneficial in future lives, the rest is beneficial in this life.
>>> If it is only a happy state of mind that I want,
>>> I ought to turn to gambling, drinking, etc.
>>> If, for the sake of reputation,
>>> They spend all their money and even get themselves killed,
>>> What use will mere words be to them?
>>> If they are dead, who is going to enjoy them?
>>> When their sandcastles collapse,
>>> Children howl and cry.
>>> Like them, when praise and reputation decline,
>>> My mind is like a child’s.
>>> The first two lines indicate the loss of happiness in this life, the third line indicates the hollowness of mere words and the fourth indicates that they are useless in future lives. In the second verse, the first two lines give an example of this and the second two lines apply the meaning of the example. 
>>> Because it has no consciousness,
>>> A fleeting sound cannot consciously praise me.
>>> ‘But praising me makes someone else happy.
>>> Is that not a cause of joy?’
>>> What difference does it make to me
>>> Whether their joy is based on me or someone else?
>>> The happiness and joy belongs to them alone.
>>> I will not get even a little bit of it.
>>> The joy that others have in oneself does not benefit oneself. That joy is merely a happy state of mind for the person who is joyful. 
>>> If his happiness gives me happiness,
>>> Then it should do so in every case.
>>> If it did, I would not be so unhappy
>>> When someone is made happy by their joy in others.
>>> If the happiness of another gives oneself happiness, then when someone takes joy in someone else, one would not be impatient with their happiness.
>>> Therefore, it is the thought, ‘They are praising me’
>>> That brings me joy.
>>> This is really ridiculous.
>>> It is the behaviour of a child.
>>> 1.	It prevents rebirth in the lower realms
>>> 1. It prevents rebirth in the lower realms
>>> Praise and so forth only distract me.
>>> They ruin my dissatisfaction with saṃsāra. 
>>> They make me envious of those who have something good,
>>> And destroy anything that is excellent.
>>> Therefore, those who are at hand
>>> To destroy my praise, etc.
>>> Are they not in fact
>>> Protecting me from the lower realms?
>>> The shackles of acquisition and honour
>>> Are not needed for the pursuit of liberation,
>>> So how can I be angry
>>> With someone who frees me from them?
>>> They are like Buddhas bestowing blessings upon me—
>>> Holding me back and bolting the door
>>> As I try to run towards suffering.
>>> How can I be angry with them?
>>> The first two lines indicate that acquisition and honour are the causes of being shackled to saṃsāra. The next two lines indicate that someone who opposes them is releasing one from those shackles. The next three lines give an example of averting one’s own suffering. The last line indicates that, therefore, it is wrong to be angry with them.
>>> ‘He is obstructing my merit.’
>>> It is not right to be angry with him either,
>>> For if there is no austerity equal to patience,
>>> Shouldn’t I stick to it?
>>> It is my own fault
>>> That I do not practise patience towards him
>>> When the cause of merit is at hand,
>>> So I am the only obstruction.
>>> If, without them, nothing happens but,
>>> When they are present, it happens,
>>> That person is a cause,
>>> So how can I call them an obstruction?
>>> A beggar arriving during alms-giving
>>> Is hardly an obstruction to giving,
>>> And it would be absurd to say that an abbot
>>> Is an obstruction to taking ordination. 
>>> The first is an example of giving and the second of moral conduct.
>>> In this world, there are plenty of beggars,
>>> But few who do us harm,
>>> For unless I have harmed them,
>>> They will not harm me.
>>> Therefore, like a treasure appearing 
>>> In my own home without my doing anything,
>>> They help me practise the bodhisattva conduct,
>>> So I should take joy in enemies.
>>> Both he and I are involved in this,
>>> So the results of practising patience
>>> Should be given to him first,
>>> For he was the cause.
>>> ‘But he did not intend for me to practise patience.
>>> I should not have such respect for an enemy.’
>>> He is nevertheless a cause of practice,
>>> And do you not respect the holy dharma for the same thing?
>>> ‘But my enemy really was intending to harm me,
>>> So I should not respect him.’
>>> If he was working for my benefit, like a doctor,
>>> How could I practise patience?
>>> Therefore, since the arising of patience
>>> Completely depends upon someone’s hostility,
>>> That person is a cause of patience,
>>> So I should respect him like I respect the holy dharma.
>>> Just as we respect the Teacher [Buddha] because he is the basis of merit, so we should equally respect sentient beings, who are also the basis of merit.
>>> Therefore, as the Sage has taught, 
>>> The field of sentient beings is a Buddha field.
>>> Sentient beings are the bodhisattva’s Buddha field, the Buddha field in which the qualities of a Buddha will be attained. To practise otherwise is wrong. One should think of them accordingly.22
>>> Many have practised respect for them and,
>>> In that way, completely crossed over.
>>> Having practised in the field only of sentient beings, many Buddhas have crossed over and been freed from saṃsāra. Thus it is a Buddha field.
>>> The Buddha qualities are established
>>> Through sentient beings and Buddhas alike,
>>> So how can I respect the conquerors
>>> But not also respect sentient beings?
>>> It is not in their respective intentions
>>> That they are equal but in their results.
>>> It is in this sense that sentient beings have the qualities
>>> Due to which they are like the Buddha.
>>> The greatness of sentient beings
>>> Is there in venerating someone who has a loving mind.
>>> The greatness of the Buddha
>>> Is there in the merit of having faith in him.
>>> It is taught that there is greater merit in venerating someone who is practising loving kindness than there is in venerating a monk [340] who is practising renunciation. Hence, the meditation of loving kindness is preeminent. Since sentient beings are the basis of that meditation, it is established that sentient beings are an excellent basis of merit. Since there is merit in having faith in the Buddha, faith in the Buddha is preeminent. Since the Buddha is the basis of that [faith], it is established that the Buddha is an excellent basis of merit.
>>> It is in respect of their producing the Buddha qualities
>>> Therefore, that we hold them equal,
>>> The position we hold is that sentient beings and Buddhas are equal. In what respect? In respect of their both being fields from which the conditions for establishing the Buddha qualities are created. Therefore, they are equal in this regard.
>>> But none is equal to the Buddha, 
>>> Who has limitless oceans of qualities.
>>> His collection of supreme qualities is unequalled but,
>>> If someone with just a fraction of those qualities were to appear,
>>> Then to offer him even the three realms
>>> Would be a small offering.
>>> ‘Collection of supreme qualities’ means mastery of the ten powers, etc. ‘Unequalled’ means the Buddha is peerless. ‘Just a fraction of those qualities’ means that although it is impossible for sentient beings to have all the qualities of the Buddha, nevertheless they do possess one of these, i.e. being a field of accumulation. Therefore, if one were to make offerings to someone who encompasses merely the cause of those qualities, to offer him everything in the three realms would be a small offering. 
>>> Since sentient beings have a part in generating
>>> The supreme Buddha qualities,
>>> It is right to venerate them
>>> Just for their doing this.
>>> 1.	The Buddhas treat sentient beings as their own [341]
>>> 1. The Buddhas treat sentient beings as their own
>>> 2.	One should be patient with harm-doers
>>> Furthermore, apart from my dedication to sentient beings,
>>> How can I ever repay
>>> Their steadfast friendship
>>> And their carrying out limitless benefit?
>>> ‘Steadfast friendship’ refers to their aspiration, which is loving. ‘Carrying out of limitless benefit’ refers to their application. Similarly, one can return the benefit they give one by one’s dedication to sentient beings, i.e. by treating them as one’s own.
>>> 2. One should be patient with harm-doers
>>> If I am to repay the benefit
>>> Of those who give up their bodies to enter the Avīci Hell,
>>> I should do everything good for everyone,
>>> Even if they do me great harm.
>>> To repay the Buddhas who, having given up their bodies to enter the Avīci Hell, work to benefit sentient beings, one should be patient with sentient beings who do one harm.
>>> If our masters sometimes act
>>> Without regard even for their own bodies,
>>> How can I, a confused person,
>>> Have such conceit as to not be their servant?
>>> As the Buddhas are one’s masters, it would be wrong to be filled with self-importance, as they work for the benefit of others. Rather, one should act as their servant.
>>> The sages are pleased when beings are made happy,
>>> And displeased when they are harmed. 
>>> By bringing beings joy, we please all the sages but,
>>> By harming beings, we harm the sages.
>>> Just as no object of desire could delight
>>> Someone whose whole body is on fire,
>>> So when sentient beings are harmed, 
>>> There is no way to please the great compassionate ones.
>>> Therefore, since I have harmed beings,
>>> And displeased the great compassionate ones,
>>> I now confess every one of those nonvirtues,
>>> And ask the sages to be patient with everything I have done to displease them.
>>> To please the tathāgatas,
>>> From now on I will serve the world.
>>> Even if many beings kick me in the head, beat me 
>>> And try to kill me, I will not retaliate but will please the lords of the world.
>>> There is no doubt that the lords of compassion
>>> Treat all beings as their own selves.
>>> I may see them as sentient beings
>>> But the protectors see them as self. Why then do I have no respect?
>>> 2.	An example from the perspective of the result
>>> This is what pleases the tathāgatas,
>>> And it perfectly accomplishes my own benefit.
>>> It even dispels the world’s sufferings.
>>> Therefore, I should always practise this.
>>> The first line refers to pleasing the conquerors by practising respect for sentient beings. The second line indicates that this also accomplishes one’s own benefit. The last two lines indicate that sentient beings have the power of liberation.
>>> 2. An example from the perspective of the result
>>> For example, though one of the king’s men
>>> May harm many people,
>>> The judicious people
>>> Do not retaliate, even though they could.
>>> For he is not alone,
>>> But his power is that of the king.
>>> Similarly, I should not have contempt
>>> For even the weakest of harm-doers,
>>> For they are supported by legions
>>> Of hell-guardians and compassionate ones.
>>> Therefore, like the subjects of a wrathful king,
>>> I should try to placate sentient beings.
>>> Even though they can return the harm done to them by someone close to the king, they do not do so out of fear of the king himself. Similarly, out of fear of rebirth in hell by going against the teachings of the Buddha, one should not return harm to sentient beings even though one is able.
>>> If the king were to become angry
>>> He could not bring the miseries of hell upon me.
>>> Yet, that is what is brought about
>>> By my harming sentient beings. 
>>> On the other hand, if the king were to be pleased, 
>>> He could not bestow buddhahood upon me.
>>> Yet, that is what is brought about 
>>> By my pleasing sentient beings.
>>> Quite apart from the fact that the future achievement of buddhahood
>>> Comes from pleasing sentient beings,
>>> Can I not see that patience brings good fortune,
>>> Reputation and prosperity?
>>> In saṃsāra, patience brings beauty,
>>> Good health and reputation,
>>> A long life,
>>> And all the vast pleasures of a universal emperor.
>>> The first two lines indicate the principal result. The second two lines indicate the visible results [in this life]. The second verse indicates the fully ripened result [in future lives].
>>> 5. The Great One (chen po or blo, Skt. mahat or buddhi) is the first evolution of the disequilibrium of the primal matter. Pride, nga rgyal, means misidentifying the manifestations as self. The five bare elements, de tsam, are sounds, smells, tastes, touchables and colours. The five elements, ’byung ba, are the gross elements of fire, water, earth, air and space. The eleven organs, dbang po, are the five senses, five action organs and the mind (yid). These twenty-three manifestations, in addition to the primal substance and the individual consciousness, comprise the twenty-five ontological enumerations of this school. See commentary to v9.127 for a more detailed description of this system.
>>> Chapter 7: Effort
>>> 3.	Abandoning opposing factors [v2b-30]
>>> With such patience, I should undertake effort,
>>> For there is enlightenment in effort.
>>> Just as there is no movement without wind,
>>> So there is no merit without effort.
>>> What is effort? Joy in virtue.
>>> 3. Abandoning opposing factors
>>> 1.	Summarizing the opposing factors
>>> 1. Summarizing the opposing factors
>>> Its opposing factors are
>>> Laziness, attachment to the negative
>>> And the despondency of self-loathing. 
>>> ‘Laziness’ means finding no joy in anything good through one’s compulsion towards inferior happiness. ‘Attachment to the negative’ means finding joy in nonvirtue. ‘The despondency of self-loathing’ means giving up hope in the result.
>>> With the sweet taste of inactivity
>>> And the craving of sleep,
>>> I am not yet tired of the sufferings of saṃsāra,
>>> So laziness arises.
>>> 3.	It will befall one
>>> 5.	The time of death is too late
>>> Hunted by the defilements,
>>> I will be caught in the trap of rebirth,
>>> And disappear into the jaws of the Lord of Death.
>>> Do I understand this at all?
>>> Just as there is no getting away for one caught in a hunter’s trap, so, for one caught in the trap of rebirth which comes from the defilements of former lives, death is certain. 
>>> Our kind are being gradually eradicated.
>>> Can you not see that?
>>> Those who go on sleeping regardless
>>> Are like cattle before their butchers.
>>> By seeing that oneself and those who, like oneself, are caught in the trap of rebirth, will die, it makes sense to practise effort through giving up sleep and inactivity. Regarding cattle and their butchers, although the cattle see that the butchers are slaughtering the ones before them, this does not then cause them to be afraid.
>>> 3. It will befall one
>>> Having blocked off all paths,
>>> The Lord of Death is now looking for you.
>>> How can you enjoy food?
>>> How can you enjoy sleep?
>>> Since death is approaching fast,
>>> How will I be able to accumulate merit?
>>> 5. The time of death is too late [344]
>>> At that time, even if I did abandon laziness,
>>> It would be too late. What would be the point?
>>> When I haven’t done this, have just started this,
>>> Am in the middle of this…
>>> Suddenly the Lord of Death will come,
>>> And I will cry, ‘Oh please no! It’s over!’
>>> Some activity is not done at all, something is only just started, something else is half done and so on. Yet, even while it is all incomplete, the Lord of Death will come and one will fall into despair, thinking, ‘I have to leave everything behind! It’s all over!’
>>> Overcome with misery, their eyes swollen and red, 
>>> Tears streaming down their faces,
>>> My family will have lost all hope,
>>> And all the while I will see the messengers from the Lord of Death.
>>> Tortured by the memories of my own nonvirtues
>>> And hearing the immanent sounds of hell,
>>> Terrified, I will clothe my body in excrement.
>>> What could I possibly do in such a delirious state? 
>>> If, in this life, you are terrified,
>>> Like a fish flipping about out of water,
>>> What can be said of the unbearable sufferings
>>> Of hell, created by your own nonvirtues? 
>>> How can you rest content,
>>> Having done deeds which will lead to
>>> The heating hells, where your tender flesh
>>> Will be scalded by boiling water?
>>> Wanting the result but not wanting to make an effort,
>>> Sensitive to all kinds of harm, 
>>> Like a god in the grip of death
>>> You cry out, ‘I cannot stand this suffering!’
>>> Cross the great river of suffering
>>> Using the boat of human life.
>>> Since this boat will be very difficult to find again,
>>> Now is not the time for sleeping, you fool!
>>> Having given up the supreme joy of the holy dharma,
>>> A limitless cause of joy,
>>> How can you find joy in distractions
>>> And agitations, which are causes of suffering?
>>> To enjoy the taste of holy dharma is a limitless cause of joy because it establishes manifold joys for the future. Through abandoning that, one relies on the causes of suffering, with attachment to objects of desire and abandoning joy. [345]
>>> Without despondency, with the powers,
>>> With dedication and self-control,
>>> Equalizing myself and others, 
>>> I should then exchange myself and others.
>>> ‘Without despondency’ means to have in one’s nature the characteristics of high-mindedness with which to carry out excellent activities. The antidotes to despondency, i.e. the ‘powers’, are motivation for application, reliance upon the main practice, joy and subsequent abandonment. To concentrate these powers in one’s mind when engaging in application is like amassing an army and then charging into battle. ‘Dedication’ and ‘self-control’ are just aspects of the foregoing. Then, one should rest the mind in equanimity, i.e. equalizing and exchanging oneself and others, which is the result.
>>> ‘How can I possibly become enlightened?’
>>> Don’t be so despondent.
>>> The Tathāgata, 
>>> Whose words are true, said
>>> That even bees, mosquitoes, 
>>> Wasps and worms,
>>> If they could develop the power of effort,
>>> Would attain unsurpassable enlightenment, so hard to attain.
>>> Although animals are inferior vessels, they can attain everything up to unsurpassable enlightenment. Therefore, since one has attained the basis of freedom and can differentiate what is to be accepted and rejected, if one does not abandon the bodhisattva conduct, one will attain it:
>>> Someone like me, born into humanity,
>>> Recognizing what is of benefit and harm—
>>> As long as I do not abandon the bodhisattva conduct,
>>> Why would I not attain enlightenment?
>>> The bodhisattva does not think, ‘The attainment of enlightenment is difficult, my effort is weak and feeble and I am lazy. To achieve enlightenment, one must practise for many hundreds of aeons as if one’s head were on fire. I do not think I can bear such a burden!’ Do not develop this attitude. Rather, the bodhisattva [346] should think, ‘The tathāgata, arhat, samyasambuddhas—the fully manifest Buddhas and the holy beings, who have fully manifested enlightenment, who are fully manifesting enlightenment, and who will fully manifest enlightenment—it is by that kind of moral conduct and by that kind of effort that they became fully manifest enlightened ones,  are becoming fully manifest enlightened ones, and will become fully manifest enlightened ones.’1
>>> 1.	The difficulties have great benefit
>>> 1. The difficulties have great benefit
>>> If I am more frightened at the prospect
>>> Of having to lose an arm or a leg,
>>> I have not examined what is heavy and what is light.
>>> That fear comes from my own confusion.
>>> For countless millions of aeons,
>>> Countless times I have been cut,
>>> Impaled, burned and torn apart,
>>> But I did not attain enlightenment.
>>> But the suffering through which I can accomplish
>>> Enlightenment is limited.
>>> It is like the suffering of making an incision
>>> In order to extract something painful within.
>>> All physicians use unpleasant treatments
>>> To cure illnesses.
>>> So, to overcome many sufferings,
>>> I can put up with a little unpleasantness.
>>> Yet, the supreme physician does not use
>>> Ordinary treatments like these.
>>> With his extremely gentle practice,
>>> He cures the limitless number of great sicknesses.
>>> At first, the guide only has us practise
>>> Giving away a few vegetables, etc.
>>> Eventually, having gotten used to this,
>>> We can come to give away even our own flesh.
>>> When I eventually come to regard my own body
>>> As like those vegetables, etc.
>>> Why would it be difficult
>>> To give away its flesh?
>>> There is no suffering because nonvirtue is given up.
>>> There is no lack of joy because of wisdom.
>>> It is wrong understanding that harms the mind
>>> And nonvirtues that harm the body.
>>> The first line indicates that application does not exhaust the causes of physical pleasures. The second line indicates it is the cause of a joyful mind. The last two lines indicate the true causes of physical and mental suffering. 
>>> Merit brings physical pleasure,
>>> And wisdom brings mental happiness.
>>> Are the compassionate ones fed up
>>> With remaining in saṃsāra for the benefit of others?
>>> Their former nonvirtues are exhausted
>>> By the force of their bodhicitta,
>>> And they gather oceans of merit,
>>> Due to which they surpass the śrāvakas.
>>> Therefore, riding the chariot of bodhicitta,
>>> Which relieves all discouragement and fatigue,
>>> And takes one from happiness to happiness,
>>> What thinking person would be despondent?
>>> The body is harmed by suffering and the mind is harmed by wrong understanding. It is these which obstruct joy. Therefore, because they are their opposites, merit and becoming wise bring the happiness of body and mind.
>>> The powers that can accomplish the benefit of beings
>>> Are motivation, steadfastness, joy and rest.
>>> The purpose of effort is to accomplish the benefit of sentient beings. Its nature is motivation, steadfastness, joy and rest. Motivation is engaging with the armour of unshakeable aspiration. Steadfastness is unfaltering application. Joy is the enthusiasm to carry out a specific task. Rest is relaxing one’s application when one becomes fatigued by it.
>>> Motivation is developed through fear of suffering
>>> And considering its benefits.
>>> This indicates the cause of motivation, i.e. it is developed through fear of suffering and consideration of the benefits of virtue.
>>> Therefore, give up the factors that oppose
>>> Motivation, pride, joy and rest,
>>> And with dedication and self-control,
>>> Work to increase effort.
>>> 3.	Self-control
>>> 3.	Cause
>>> 2.	Accomplishing all good qualities
>>> I will overcome the endless faults
>>> Of myself and others,
>>> Even if each one of those faults
>>> Takes an ocean of aeons to wear out.
>>> When I see that I have barely begun
>>> To exhaust my own faults,
>>> Why do I not have a heart attack, thinking
>>> I will end up in the realms of limitless suffering?
>>> 2. Accomplishing all good qualities
>>> I will establish the many good qualities
>>> Of myself and others,
>>> Even if each one of those qualities
>>> Takes an ocean of aeons to cultivate.
>>> Since I have never developed
>>> Much familiarity with even a part of those qualities,
>>> It is quite amazing that I, someone who has acquired 
>>> Such a rare rebirth, should act so meaninglessly.
>>> The first two lines indicate that one should establish all good qualities. The second two indicate that previous bodhisattvas engaged in all kinds of exertions. The next verse indicates how little effort one makes.
>>> I have not made offerings to the Buddhas,
>>> Nor provided great feasts.
>>> I have not done anything for the teachings,
>>> Nor fulfilled the wishes of the poor.
>>> I have not protected the frightened from what threatens them,
>>> Nor given comfort to the destitute.
>>> The only thing I have done is cause 
>>> My mother the pain and suffering of carrying me in her womb.
>>> In the past, until now,
>>> I have had no motivation for dharma,
>>> And now I am destitute like this.
>>> Who abandons the motivation for dharma?
>>> Motivation is the source
>>> Of all virtuous pursuits, as the Sage has said.
>>> The source of motivation is continual meditation
>>> On the ripening of results.
>>> Sufferings, anxieties, 
>>> All kinds of distress,
>>> And being separated from our desires
>>> All come from nonvirtue.
>>> For one who keeps a virtuous intent in mind,
>>> No matter where he goes,
>>> His merit will present offerings to him
>>> With the gifts of ripening results.
>>> But one who practises nonvirtue, though he may want happiness,
>>> No matter where he goes,
>>> Will be defeated by his nonvirtues,
>>> Bearing instruments for inflicting pain.
>>> In the vast, fragrant, cool heart of a lotus,
>>> Where the sound of the Conqueror’s words nurtures their resplendence,
>>> The virtuous, prompted by the Sage’s light, arise from a lotus in a supreme form
>>> And become children of the Sugatas in the presence of the Conqueror.
>>> The servants of the Lord of Death will relentlessly flail all the skin from their bodies,
>>> And pour molten copper, liquefied by ferocious furnaces, down their throats.
>>> As one hundred chunks of flesh are gouged from them with red hot swords and knives,
>>> The nonvirtuous will fall upon the fiercely blazing iron ground.
>>> Therefore, I should be motivated to virtue,
>>> And develop enthusiasm for it.
>>> I should cultivate pride from the outset
>>> According to the practice of Vajradhvaja.
>>> I should assess my own resources
>>> Before deciding whether or not to undertake something.
>>> It is better not to undertake it
>>> Than to undertake it and then stop,
>>> For that habit will continue in future lives,
>>> And increase nonvirtue and suffering.
>>> Also, other actions and their results 
>>> Will be weakened and will not be accomplished.
>>> The fault of undertaking and then stopping is that one becomes habituated to stopping in future lives. This is called the ‘effect similar to the cause’. An increase of negative deeds in this life is called the ‘proliferating effect’. An increase in suffering throughout future lives is called the ‘fully ripened effect’. It diminishes other actions—i.e. since conduct ceases, it is an action diminishing the unattained. It also diminishes results—i.e. since it is impossible to attain the results themselves, it is an action diminishing the attained. Since one does not fulfil what should have been accomplished, it is an action diminishing their attainment.4
>>> 2.	Pride in actions
>>> 4.	Pride in overcoming the defilements
>>> I should take pride in three things:
>>> Actions, defilements and ability.
>>> •	Considering oneself as superior, to engender the thought, ‘Nobody else can abandon faults and accomplish good qualities’ is pride in ability.
>>> 2. Pride in actions
>>> ‘I will do it alone.’
>>> This is pride in actions.
>>> The world is overpowered by defilements
>>> And cannot achieve its own benefit.
>>> Since beings cannot do it for themselves,
>>> I will do it for them.
>>> How can I just sit here
>>> When others are performing negative actions?
>>> I don’t act because of pride,
>>> But it would be better not to have such pride.
>>> When it comes across a dying snake,
>>> A crow acts as if it were an eagle. 
>>> Similarly, when I am weakened,
>>> Even a small downfall will harm me.
>>> When I am discouraged, I give up,
>>> So how will I ever be liberated from destitution?
>>> The proud, generating exertion, 
>>> Can handle difficulties, even great ones.
>>> Therefore, with a steady mind,
>>> I will overcome all downfalls,
>>> For if I am defeated by the defilements,
>>> My wish to conquer the three realms would be a joke.
>>> ‘I will conquer all,
>>> And be conquered by nothing.’
>>> I, a child of conquering lions,
>>> Should take pride in this.
>>> [351] The first two lines indicate the wish to conquer all among the three worlds. The second two lines indicate the subsequent training of a child of the conquerors.
>>> Whoever is defeated by their pride
>>> Does not have this pride; he has defilements.
>>> The proud are not overpowered by their enemies;
>>> They bring the enemy pride under their power. 
>>> Their defilements inflate them with pride,
>>> And their pride leads them to the lower realms.
>>> It steals the wealth of their human life,
>>> And leaves them a slave, begging food from others,
>>> Stupid, ugly and pathetic,
>>> Despised wherever they go.
>>> If these wretches, inflated with pride,
>>> Are counted among the proud,
>>> Who could be considered shamed?
>>> The first two lines indicate that someone whose antidotal pride is defeated has defilements and does not take pride in his abilities. Why? Because taking pride in one’s abilities acts as an antidote to the defilements and thus overpowers them (lines 56cd). The next lines indicate that taking pride in one’s abilities brings happiness, while here the person attains suffering, i.e. they are led to the suffering of the lower realms (57ab) and, even while they are in the higher realms, they experience painful sufferings (57c-58b). The last two lines indicate that if such a person is proud, nobody would be shamed.
>>> Whoever takes pride in conquering the enemy pride
>>> Is one of the proud and a completely victorious hero.
>>> Whoever finally overcomes the enemy pride when it is upon him
>>> Brings the results of his conquest to completion in accord with the wishes of beings.
>>> ‘The proud’ are those who take pride in conquering the enemy pride. Though the enemy pride is upon him, the one who overcomes it is a hero. If he brings the results of his conquest to completion in accord with the wishes of beings, he is completely victorious.
>>> 4. Pride in overcoming the defilements
>>> Amid the amassing defilements,
>>> I will withstand them in a thousand ways.
>>> Like a lion among foxes,
>>> The host of defilements will not disturb me.
>>> In a deadly situation,
>>> People protect their eyes.
>>> Similarly, even in a threatening situation,
>>> I will not fall under the power of the defilements.
>>> It would be better to be burned alive
>>> Or decapitated
>>> Than to be constantly grovelling
>>> To the enemy defilements.
>>> Similarly, in all circumstances,
>>> I should do nothing apart from what is appropriate.
>>> Whatever actions are to be done,
>>> I will carry them out
>>> Like someone who enjoys the playing of a game as its own reward;
>>> I will insatiably delight in participating.
>>> When we act for the sake of our own happiness,
>>> We do not know whether we will get it or not.
>>> But how can one for whom the action itself brings happiness
>>> Be happy without doing it?
>>> If I never have enough sense pleasures,
>>> Which are like honey on a razor’s edge,
>>> How can I ever have enough merit,
>>> Which ripens in happiness and bliss?
>>> Therefore, in order to carry out an action,
>>> I will engage in it
>>> Like an elephant tormented by the midday sun,
>>> Plunging into a lake.
>>> If, after some time, my strength declines,
>>> I should leave it so I can return to it later.
>>> When I have completed something properly, 
>>> I should leave it, wanting to get on with the next thing.
>>> 2.	Dedication to mindfulness and clear comprehension
>>> Like engaging in a sword fight
>>> With a veteran enemy warrior,
>>> I will dodge the defilement weapons
>>> And cut down the defilement enemies.
>>> 2. Dedication to mindfulness and clear comprehension
>>> If I dropped my sword in battle,
>>> I would hurriedly snatch it up, horrified.
>>> Likewise, if I lose the blade of mindfulness,
>>> I will quickly restore it, in horror of hell.
>>> Poison spreads throughout the body
>>> By means of the blood.
>>> Likewise, if they find an opportunity
>>> Faults will spread throughout my mind.
>>> Practitioners should be as careful
>>> As someone carrying a pot of mustard oil,
>>> Attended by a knifeman 
>>> Threatening to kill them if they should spill any.
>>> I would hurriedly jump up
>>> If a snake slid onto my lap.
>>> Likewise, if I sink into sleep or lethargy,
>>> I will quickly repel them.
>>> Each time some fault occurs,
>>> I should reproach myself, 
>>> Reflecting for a long time,
>>> ‘I will not allow this to happen again.’
>>> ‘How can I develop mindfulness
>>> In these particular circumstances?’
>>> With this in mind, I should plan for
>>> Occasions of meeting and practising.
>>> 3. Self-control
>>> The means of practising self-control:
>>> Before committing any act,
>>> I should be fully prepared.
>>> Calling to mind the advice on concern,
>>> I should proceed to carry it out.
>>> The result of effort in self-control:
>>> Like cotton blown back and forth
>>> Under the power of the wind,
>>> I should accomplish everything in this way
>>> Under the power of enthusiasm.
>>> 1. H232, p.33a. Sonam Tsemo adds ‘and so forth’ here, i.e. the passage continues, as quoted in the Śikṣā-samuccaya: 
>>> ‘They did not attain enlightenment while already being tathāgatas. In the same way, I shall strive and in the same way I shall practise diligently. With effort shared with all sentient beings, with effort that takes all sentient beings as its object, I will completely awaken to unsurpassable complete enlightenment.’ (The Training Anthology of Śāntideva: A Translation of the Śikṣā-samuccaya, p. 58)
>>> 3. H94, 174a. That version is slightly more descriptive and hence longer than the one quoted here. This sutra passage is also quoted in the Śikṣā-samuccaya (D3940, 153a, under v24 of the root verses) in the longer form, though with yet another translation. All the Tibetan editions of Sonam Tsemo’s commentary here erroneously have ri mo mnyams for ri mi mnyams (‘the rugged mountains’).
>>> Chapter 8: Meditation
>>> 3.	Giving up conceptual discrimination
>>> Having developed effort in this way,
>>> I should place my mind in samādhi.
>>> Someone whose mind is distracted
>>> Lives between the jaws of the defilements.
>>> With the isolation of body and mind,
>>> There are no distractions.
>>> Therefore, I should abandon this world,
>>> And give up all conceptual discrimination.
>>> Why should one place the mind, as it says, in samādhi after developing effort? It is to abandon conceptual distractions. What is the problem if one does not abandon them? As explained in lines 1cd, if one is overpowered by objects, it is easy to be devoured by the defilements. How can one abandon distraction? Lines 2ab explain this. If one wonders what the method is for the isolation of body and mind, it is given in lines 2cd, i.e. to abandon craving for the causes of distraction. 
>>> Out of attachment and craving for possessions, etc. 
>>> I do not abandon this world.
>>> ‘Attachment’ means attachment to the bodies of others which are aggregations of the five perpetuating skandhas. [354] ‘Craving for possessions, etc.’ means attachment to external enjoyments.
>>> Therefore, to completely abandon it,
>>> The wise should analyse it as follows.
>>> Understanding that insight with complete calm abiding
>>> Will utterly destroy the defilements,
>>> I should seek calm abiding first,
>>> And that is achieved through the joy of having no worldly attachment.
>>> The first two lines briefly summarize abandoning the world. The next two lines indicate that the defilements are destroyed by the unification of calm abiding and insight. The next line indicates that the cause of insight is calm abiding. The last line indicates that the cause of calm abiding is abandoning attachment to the world.
>>> 2.	Establishing non-attachment towards possessions, etc.
>>> Which impermanent person would have attachment
>>> To another impermanent person?
>>> He will not see his loved one again
>>> For thousands of lifetimes.
>>> I am unhappy when I don’t see them
>>> And my mind will not settle.
>>> Yet, even when I see them, I am not satisfied,
>>> But just as tormented by craving as before.
>>> If one is attached to sentient beings,
>>> Reality is obscured,
>>> Renunciation is forgotten,
>>> And one ends up suffering in misery.
>>> Thinking solely of them,
>>> This life passes by without any meaning.
>>> 2.	They lead one to lower rebirths
>>> The unchanging dharma
>>> Is lost though transient friends.
>>> 2. They lead one to lower rebirths
>>> If I act like a fool,
>>> I will surely go to the lower realms.
>>> If they are leading me to that different end,
>>> Why would I follow such fools?
>>> One second they are friends
>>> But, in an instant, they become enemies.
>>> Since they get angry even in joyful situations,
>>> People are very hard to please.
>>> If I say something helpful, they get angry,
>>> And oppose my help.
>>> If I don’t listen to them,
>>> They get angry, and then will go to a bad rebirth.
>>> They are envious of superiors, competitive towards equals,
>>> And arrogant towards inferiors. When praised, they become conceited.
>>> When criticized, they get angry.
>>> What good can ever come from such children?
>>> When associating with the childish, 
>>> We praise ourselves and criticize other children,
>>> And nonvirtues, like discussing 
>>> The joys of saṃsāra, inevitably occur.
>>> To associate with others like this
>>> Only brings loss.
>>> Therefore, since I will not benefit them,
>>> And they will not benefit me,
>>> I should stay far away from childish people.
>>> When I come across them, I should be happy to please them.
>>> Without being very familiar,
>>> I should treat them well just like any ordinary person.
>>> Like a bee taking nectar from a flower,
>>> I should accept only what is for the dharma.
>>> I should remain unfamiliar,
>>> As if they were someone I had never met before.
>>> 2. Establishing non-attachment towards possessions, etc.
>>> ‘I have lots of possessions and respect.
>>> I am really popular.’
>>> If I hold on to such thoughts,
>>> My death will be horrible.
>>> Therefore, whatever it is 
>>> That this utterly confused mind desires,
>>> Along with it comes
>>> A thousand sufferings.
>>> Therefore, the wise don’t have desires.
>>> Fear comes from desire.
>>> Since it is the nature of things to be let go of,
>>> I will be firm and recognize this well.
>>> I may have many possessions,
>>> And I may be famous and praised,
>>> But these possessions and fame—
>>> I don’t know what will become of them.
>>> Why does someone’s praise please me,
>>> When there is someone else to criticize me?
>>> Why does someone’s criticism displease me,
>>> When there is someone else to praise me?
>>> If even the Conqueror could not satisfy
>>> The various inclinations of sentient beings,
>>> What can one say of a wretch like me?
>>> Therefore, I will give up thinking about worldly people.
>>> They criticize those who have no possessions,
>>> And complain about those who have them.
>>> Since they are so difficult to get along with,
>>> How can they bring me any joy?
>>> The Tathāgata said,
>>> ‘Since the childish are not happy
>>> Unless they are benefitting themselves,
>>> The childish are friends to no one.’
>>> In the forest, the deer, birds
>>> And trees do not speak unpleasantly.
>>> When will I come to live among
>>> Such good company?
>>> Staying in caves or deserted shrines,
>>> Or at the foot of a tree—
>>> I will not look back
>>> But will be free from attachment.
>>> When will I come to live
>>> In naturally spacious places,
>>> Not claimed by anyone as their own,
>>> Free to do as I please, without attachment?
>>> Having just a begging bowl and a few things,
>>> Wearing clothes not wanted by anyone,
>>> Not even having to conceal this body—
>>> When will I come to live without worry?
>>> When will I go to the burial ground, where,
>>> Between my body and those heaps of bones,
>>> There is no difference
>>> In our subjection to disintegration?
>>> That is where this body of mine will end up,
>>> With a stink so putrid
>>> That not even the wolves
>>> Will want to go near it.
>>> If the very flesh and bones
>>> That comprise my body
>>> Must come apart,
>>> What can be said of friendships?
>>> When we are born, we are born alone.
>>> When we die, we die alone.
>>> If they cannot relieve us of our burden of suffering,
>>> What do friends do but create obstacles?
>>> The first two lines indicate that friends are impermanent. The third line indicates that they cannot take on one’s own share of suffering. The last line indicates that they create obstacles to one’s benefit.
>>> As travellers on the roads
>>> Take their places to stay,
>>> So, on the paths of conditioned existence,
>>> All take their places of birth.
>>> While everyone is completely grief-stricken,
>>> Four pallbearers carry someone away.
>>> Before that time comes for me,
>>> I will go to the forest.
>>> I will stay alone in isolation,
>>> Somewhere without friends or antagonists.
>>> When I die, since they will already think of me as dead,
>>> I won’t cause them any distress.
>>> And since they won’t be around me,
>>> Being miserable and causing problems,
>>> Nobody will be able to distract me
>>> From mindfulness of the Buddha and so on.
>>> Therefore, I will go to live
>>> In the bright, beautiful forest where,
>>> With few problems, happy and content,
>>> All disturbances will be pacified.
>>> 3. Giving up conceptual discrimination
>>> Although there are many ways to give up conceptual discrimination in general, since the conceptual discrimination of desirable objects is particularly difficult to abandon, this section focuses specifically on the antidotes for that.
>>> 2.	Examining the impure nature
>>> Giving up all other purposes,
>>> I will endeavour single-mindedly
>>> To place my mind in meditative equipoise
>>> And subdue it.
>>> One should make an effort to place the mind in samādhi, resting in equipoise upon wisdom and subduing it in moral conduct. 
>>> In this world and in the next,
>>> Our desires bring us only ruin.
>>> Here, we are killed, imprisoned and broken,
>>> And in the next, we go to the hells.
>>> 1.	Impurity connected with the burial ground
>>> 1. Impurity connected with the burial ground
>>> 2.	It is nothing other than what is discarded in the burial ground
>>> To get her, you had entreated her,
>>> With messengers, male and female,
>>> Without any thought
>>> For nonvirtue or shame.
>>> You would do things that terrified you,
>>> Waste your wealth and,
>>> When she was finally in your arms,
>>> Were overjoyed with what was really
>>> Nothing but a skeleton,
>>> The first six lines establish the difficulty of the acquisition. The next two lines indicate [358] grasping the situation as joyful. The last line indicates having nothing but a skeleton.
>>> With neither autonomy nor self.
>>> But because of your intense desire and attraction to her,
>>> You did not go beyond suffering.
>>> 2. It is nothing other than what is discarded in the burial ground
>>> At first, you tried to get her 
>>> To raise her face to you but, modestly, she looked down.
>>> Whether anyone could see her or not,
>>> She covered her face with a veil.
>>> That face, which so concerned you,
>>> Is right there before you now,
>>> For the vultures have stripped it bare—
>>> So why do you run away?
>>> When someone looked at her,
>>> You would completely shield her face from him,
>>> But now that the vultures are eating that face away,
>>> Why, selfish, don’t you protect it?
>>> Seeing this pile of flesh
>>> Being eaten by vultures and other creatures,
>>> Why don’t you go and present to their food 
>>> Those flower garlands, sandalwood and ornaments?
>>> If you are afraid of a mere pile of bones,
>>> Even though it cannot possibly move,
>>> Why are you not frightened
>>> By something that stirs like a zombie?
>>> You wanted it when it was covered.
>>> Why don’t you want it now it is uncovered?
>>> If you have no need of it now,
>>> Why did you want it then?
>>> If excrement and saliva
>>> Come from the same source—food,
>>> Why do you love her saliva,
>>> But not her excrement?
>>> You don’t have any love for your pillow
>>> Of soft cotton but,
>>> Telling yourself she doesn’t really stink,
>>> Your desire confuses you about what is impure.
>>> Those confused, desirous wretches,
>>> Though their pillows are soft,
>>> Get angry, saying,
>>> ‘I can’t copulate with this!’
>>> If you aren’t attracted to impurity,
>>> Why do you embrace 
>>> A cage of bones joined by ligaments,
>>> And plastered over with flesh?
>>> You yourself have plenty of impurity,
>>> Which you continually have to experience,
>>> And yet you hungrily chase after the filth of others
>>> Though they, too, are bags of impurity.
>>> ‘It’s just their flesh I enjoy.’
>>> If that is what you want to see and touch,
>>> Do you want it in its natural state,
>>> Devoid of a mind?
>>> The mind that you desire
>>> Cannot be seen or touched,
>>> So it makes no sense to want to copulate with it.
>>> What can be seen and touched is not conscious.
>>> Neither self nor other is an object of attraction:
>>> It is unremarkable to misunderstand
>>> The impure nature of other bodies,
>>> But it is very remarkable to misunderstand
>>> The impurity you yourself have.
>>> Not noticing a young lotus flower,
>>> Spreading its petals in the sunlight on a cloudless day,
>>> Why is the mind so attracted to impurity,
>>> And drawn to cages of impurity?
>>> 3.	It makes no sense to want impurity
>>> 4.	Establishing the impurity of one’s own body
>>> If you don’t want to touch
>>> An area covered in excrement,
>>> Why do you want to touch
>>> The body it issued from?
>>> If you are not attracted to impurity,
>>> Why do you want to copulate with the body parts of others,
>>> Which came from an impure place,
>>> And developed from an impure seed.
>>> You are not attracted to 
>>> A tiny grub, born on excrement.
>>> Yet, you are attracted to bodies which have many natural impurities,
>>> And are even born from impurities.
>>> 3. It makes no sense to want impurity
>>> Not only do you not mind
>>> The impurity of your own body,
>>> But, wanting even more impurity,
>>> You desire other bags of impurity, too.
>>> 4. Establishing the impurity of one’s own body
>>> When pleasing substances like camphor,
>>> Rice or cooked vegetables
>>> Are spat out after chewing,
>>> Even the ground is considered dirty.
>>> Though such impurity is quite obvious,
>>> If there are any doubts about it,
>>> Take a look at the bodies in the cemetery.
>>> You can see even more impurity there.
>>> If someone’s skin were to be peeled away,
>>> You would be completely horrified.
>>> You know this, so how can you
>>> Ever be attracted to such a thing again?
>>> Scents applied to the body
>>> Are of sandalwood and so forth, nothing else.
>>> Why are you attracted to things
>>> That smell of something else?
>>> The body’s natural smell is awful.
>>> Isn’t it right not to be attracted to it?
>>> Why do the worldly, craving something meaningless,
>>> Daub it with a fragrance?
>>> For, if the fragrance is that of sandalwood,
>>> How could it come from the body?
>>> Why are you attracted to things
>>> That smell of something else?
>>> The body in its natural state,
>>> With long hair and nails,
>>> With stinking, grey teeth, covered with foul-smelling dirt,
>>> And naked, is actually frightening.
>>> Why make such an effort to clean up
>>> Something that is like a weapon for wounding me?
>>> This world is in chaos
>>> With lunatics, frantic in their self-centred confusion.
>>> Having seen a few skeletons in the cemetery,
>>> You felt revulsion.
>>> So are you happy in this cemetery city,
>>> Full of moving skeletons?
>>> In this way, you cannot have
>>> Such impurity without paying a price.
>>> For those who get it, exhaustion
>>> And agonies such as those of hell ensue.
>>> Wealth is necessary for a wife, etc. The exhaustion of those who get it indicates the difficulties of pursuing wealth in this life. The agonies of hell, etc. indicates the harms of next life.
>>> 1.	The desirable object itself is not attained
>>> 1. The desirable object itself is not attained
>>> Children cannot amass any wealth,
>>> And the young cannot enjoy it.
>>> When life is wasted chasing them,
>>> What use are those desires to the old?
>>> Some miserable people, full of desire,
>>> Are completely worn out at the end of a long day.
>>> They come home and collapse,
>>> Their lifeless bodies sleeping like the dead.
>>> Some are afflicted by travelling,
>>> And have to suffer being far from home.
>>> Though they miss their families,
>>> They will not see them for years on end.
>>> One cannot attain what one desires due to coming under the control of others:
>>> Some confused ones, wanting to help themselves,
>>> Sell whatever they have but,
>>> Without getting what they wanted, are driven aimlessly
>>> By the winds of others’ karma.
>>> Some sell their own bodies,
>>> And are helplessly exploited by others.
>>> If his wife should give birth, she must do so 
>>> At the foot of a tree or in whatever remote place she finds herself.
>>> Fools, deceived by their desire,
>>> Want a livelihood and, thinking they will make a living,
>>> Join the army, though they are afraid of dying,
>>> Coming under the control of others:
>>> Or enter into servitude for money.
>>> Some desirous people can be seen with broken bodies,
>>> Or impaled upon stakes,
>>> Or pierced by blades,
>>> Or even burned.
>>> Sufferings amassed in the three times:
>>> Due to the anxieties of getting, keeping and losing wealth,
>>> Understand that its problems are endless.
>>> Those who become distracted by attachment to wealth
>>> Have no opportunity for liberation from the sufferings of saṃsāra.
>>> Those who have desire for such things
>>> Will have many problems and little satisfaction.
>>> They are like beasts pulling a wagon,
>>> Able to eat just a few mouthfuls of grass.
>>> For the sake of something that gives little satisfaction
>>> And which is so common that even animals can get it,
>>> Those tormented by their karma waste the magnificent freedoms and endowments 
>>> That they had acquired with such difficulty.
>>> The objects of desire will inevitably perish,
>>> But I will fall into the hells and so forth.
>>> For the sake of something not very important,
>>> I have been wearing myself out.
>>> If buddhahood itself can be attained
>>> With just a millionth of that difficulty,
>>> Having desire is much more suffering
>>> Than practising the bodhisattva conduct but without any enlightenment.
>>> When one thinks about the sufferings of the hells,
>>> The dangers of weapons, poisoning, fires, ravines
>>> And enemies are nothing 
>>> Compared to the objects of desire.
>>> ‘Beasts pulling a wagon, able to eat a few mouthfuls of grass’ means that the sufferings they experience are much greater than the happiness they get from eating. ‘So common that even animals can get it’ refers to sexual intercourse. ‘Been wearing myself out’ means from beginningless time until now. ‘Buddhahood itself can be attained with just a millionth of the difficulty’ refers to the three incalculable aeons.3 To ‘think about the sufferings of the hells’ means that the sufferings of poisoning, etc. are not even a fraction of that because they are just human sufferings.
>>> 2. Developing joy in solitude
>>> Disillusioned with the objects of desire,
>>> I will develop joy in solitude.
>>> In peaceful forests,
>>> With no conflict or defilements,
>>> Fortunate ones, cooled by sandalwood moonlight,
>>> Stroll and contemplate the benefit of others,
>>> Among wondrous palaces of immense rocks,
>>> As a silent, soothing forest breeze blows.
>>> One is cooled by moonlight, like the cooling sandalwood water of a king’s palace. The vast slabs of rock are like a king’s palace. A gentle forest breeze blows, like wafting fans cooling a king. One is free to focus on the benefit of others and carry out one’s daily activities, just as a king considers the affairs of his realm and carries them out.
>>> In an empty hut, at the foot of a tree or in a cave,
>>> They stay as long as they want.
>>> They have left behind the sufferings of masters and protection and,
>>> Not reliant on anyone, live carefree.
>>> Free and without attachment,
>>> Not tied to anyone,
>>> They live with a contentment and happiness
>>> That even Indra would have difficulty finding.
>>> 1.	Equalizing self and others
>>> 2.	Exchanging self and others
>>> 1. Equalizing self and others
>>> What is the cause of meditating on equalizing self and others? 
>>> Having considered how solitude 
>>> Has such good qualities,
>>> I should pacify conceptual discrimination
>>> And meditate on bodhicitta.
>>> Equalizing self and others
>>> Is the first thing to try and cultivate.
>>> Since everyone is the same when it comes to happiness
>>> And suffering, I should look after them as I do myself.
>>> Just as the whole body should be protected,
>>> Though it has many different parts—hands and so on, 
>>> So different beings, whether happy or suffering,
>>> All want to be happy, just as I do.
>>> Though my suffering doesn’t harm
>>> The bodies of others,
>>> Nevertheless, it is my suffering,
>>> And clinging to it as ‘mine’ makes it intolerable to me.
>>> Similarly, though the suffering of others
>>> Does not befall me,
>>> Nevertheless, it is my suffering,
>>> And clinging to it as ‘mine’ will make it hard for me to tolerate.
>>> The first two lines establish the reverse pervasion, i.e. if there is no self-clinging, [sufferings] do not arise as unbearable. The second two lines establish the forward pervasion, i.e. if there is self-clinging, [sufferings] arise as intolerable [i.e. to be dispelled]. The second verse concludes from this that if one grasps the streams of being of others as one’s own, [sufferings] will arise as hard to tolerate.
>>> I should expel the suffering of others
>>> Because it is suffering, like my own suffering,
>>> And I should benefit others
>>> Because they are sentient beings, like I am.
>>> The suffering of others is the logical subject. This term is related to ‘I should’ and ‘expel’, i.e. to form the proposition, ‘I should expel that’. [The reason:] because it is suffering, like one’s own suffering. Next, taking the benefit of others as the logical subject, the probandum is, ‘I should perform that’. [The reason:] because it is the happiness of a sentient being, which is like one’s own physical happiness.
>>> When you and I
>>> Are the same in wanting to be happy,
>>> What is so special about me 
>>> That I work only for myself?
>>> When you and I 
>>> Are the same in not wanting to suffer,
>>> What is so special about me 
>>> That I look after myself and not you?
>>> 3.	The error that follows from the parts of the body
>>> ‘Their suffering doesn’t hurt me,
>>> So why should I care about them?’
>>> Future sufferings don’t hurt you either,
>>> So why protect yourself from them?
>>> To think, ‘I’m the one who will experience it’,
>>> Is a mistake.
>>> It is someone else who dies after this,
>>> And someone else again who is born.
>>> 3. The error that follows from the parts of the body
>>> ‘The ones with the suffering
>>> Should look after themselves.’
>>> The suffering of the feet is not that of the hands,
>>> So why should the hands protect them?
>>> If the experiencer of suffering is pervaded by not warranting the protection of one who is not experiencing suffering, since the suffering of the feet is not experienced by the hands, it follows that the hands should not protect them. Yet, in that case, the unharmed one protects the one warranting protection from harm.
>>> ‘It may not be right,
>>> But I do it out of self-clinging.’
>>> Neither self nor other is right:
>>> You should try to give them both up.
>>> ‘Since the sufferings of others do not harm me, it is not right to protect others from them. It is not right to protect myself from experiencing the sufferings of the future either but, nevertheless, I do it out of self-clinging.’
>>> ‘Self-clinging is right, but that is other-clinging.’
>>> ‘Self-clinging to the future self is right because, despite being in a different time, there is a single cause. Clinging to other sentient beings is not right because they have distinct causes. Self-clinging is right because, despite having separate parts, the body is a unified composite. Clinging to the bodies of others is not right because they are distinct composites. Therefore it is not true that “neither self nor other is right”.’
>>> A ‘stream’ and a ‘composite’ are false,
>>> Like a string of beads or an army.
>>> The so-called ‘stream of being’ of self is the logical subject. That it is false is the probandum. [Reason:] because it is a sequential multiplicity grasped as singular, like grasping a string of beads as singular. Next, the so-called ‘composite’ is the logical subject. It is false because it is a multiplicity of moments grasped as singular, like grasping a manifold army as singular.
>>> 5. Summarizing the consistency with valid cognition
>>> Suffering is not owned by anyone,
>>> So, who should be the one to remove it? 
>>> Since the bodies of others and one’s own body are distinct, one’s mind is not the owner of the sufferings of the bodies of others. Similarly, though each particle and moment of those others are distinct, each one has the nature of suffering but none of them is the owner of that suffering, i.e. nothing constitutes an experiencer. So who is it that is subjected to that suffering? There is no self that is subjected to suffering.
>>> Sufferings have no owner:
>>> None of them is unique.
>>> If it is suffering, it should be eradicated.
>>> Why be inconsistent about this?
>>> There is no disagreement about the reason 
>>> For preventing everyone’s suffering.
>>> Therefore, [366] just as one’s own stream of being is not the owner of others’ sufferings, neither is there an experiencer of the sufferings of one’s own stream of being. Therefore, sufferings have no owner, i.e. ‘none of them is unique’. 
>>> If you prevent it at all, prevent it for all.
>>> ‘Compassion will bring me a lot of suffering,
>>> So why should I develop it?’
>>> If you think about the sufferings of living beings,
>>> How can compassion be considered a lot of suffering?
>>> They are not suffering if one ‘thinks of the sufferings of living beings’, i.e. having considered how one should prevent the sufferings of sentient beings, one will not grasp the suffering of benefitting others as suffering. Even if one were to enter the Avīci Hell for the benefit of others, one would take joy in it as if one were diving into a lotus pool. Or, having considered how great the sufferings of the lower realms and the sufferings of conditionality are, the suffering one has from such difficulties will seem comparatively minor. Or, just because the difficulties are suffering, their nature does satisfy the general reason for abandonment; nevertheless, it is a suffering which has a result, [367] i.e. since it is not a suffering which does not have a result, it does not satisfy the more specific reason for abandonment:
>>> If one person’s suffering
>>> Can stop many sufferings,
>>> A kind-hearted person would take on that suffering
>>> For his own sake and the sake of others.
>>> It was for this reason that Supuśpacandra,
>>> Though he knew the king would harm him,
>>> Did not evade his own suffering
>>> In order to exhaust many sufferings.
>>> According to the Sutra Requested by Candrapradipa,6 the dharma teacher Supuśpacandra, in the forest of Samantabhadra, perceived that if he were to go alone, he would subdue King Vīradatta,7 but the king would kill him. Despite knowing this, without any fear, he proceeded to the king’s palace, where he proclaimed the dharma. Why did he disregard his own suffering? In order to exhaust many sufferings.
>>> 1.	Undertaking the benefit of others with happiness
>>> 1. Undertaking the benefit of others with happiness
>>> One who cultivates this in their being,
>>> With the joy of pacifying the suffering of others,
>>> Would enter the Avīci Hell
>>> As if they were diving into a lotus pool.
>>> When sentient beings are completely liberated,
>>> It is an ocean of joy.
>>> Is that not enough?
>>> What use is it wanting my own liberation?
>>> In this respect, though I am benefitting others,
>>> I will do it without conceit or thinking it is a big deal.
>>> By taking joy solely in their benefit,
>>> I will not expect the ripening of any results.
>>> Therefore, just as I protect myself
>>> From the slightest criticism,
>>> So I should have a protective attitude towards others,
>>> And a compassionate intent.
>>> Just as out of habit I regard
>>> The drops of semen and blood
>>> Of others as ‘myself’,
>>> Even though they have no substance,
>>> Why don’t I regard the bodies of others 
>>> As ‘myself’ in the same way, too?
>>> Nor should it be hard to see
>>> My own body as theirs, too.
>>> The body one now clings to was previously the semen and blood of one’s parents [368] and one’s mind was distinct from it. Through habituation, conceptual thought which clings to it as self was developed. Similarly, though one’s mind is separate from them, why, through habituation, would one not be able to come to regard the streams of being of others as self?
>>> 2. Exchanging oneself and others
>>> Having recognized that self is defective,
>>> While others are an ocean of good qualities,
>>> I should completely abandon self-clinging
>>> And practise embracing others.
>>> One should regard the self as defective and others as an ocean of good qualities, regarding them as inferior and superior. Self-clinging is to be completely abandoned and others are to be regarded as one’s own stream of being. To ‘embrace others’ means having the perception in which the streams of being of others are accepted and self-grasping is rejected, i.e. thinking that they come first and oneself comes after.
>>> Just as I regard my hands, etc.
>>> As parts of my body,
>>> Why don’t I regard embodied beings
>>> As limbs of one life? 
>>> 5.	A particular practice for the benefit of others
>>> 7.	Liberation of self and others from suffering [369]
>>> Just as habituation has brought about 
>>> The idea of self for this selfless body,
>>> Why should habituation not create
>>> The same idea about sentient beings?
>>> Though body and mind are distinct, they can be grasped as self through habituation. Similarly, though the streams of being of others are distinct, if one becomes habituated, it is possible to grasp them as self.
>>> Though I might benefit others in this way,
>>> I will not have conceit or think it is a big deal,
>>> Just as one does not have a conceited attitude when benefitting oneself, similarly, when others are grasped as self, one should not have a conceited attitude in carrying out their benefit.
>>> Like not expecting a reward
>>> After eating my own food.
>>> Therefore, just as I protect myself
>>> From the slightest criticism,
>>> So I should have a protective attitude towards beings,
>>> And cultivate a compassionate intent.
>>> 5. A particular practice for the benefit of others
>>> The protector Avalokiteśvara,
>>> Out of great compassion
>>> Blessed even his own name
>>> To dispel the fear of crowds.
>>> Because everything he did was only for the benefit of others, the protector Avalokiteśvara blessed his own name, such that simply by remembering it, beings would be freed from fears such as enemies and fire and freed from anxiety among crowds. Fear of enemies and fire is what crowds are afraid of. Anxiety among crowds is the fear of being among crowds.
>>> I shouldn’t turn away from difficulty.
>>> Just hearing someone’s name might have once frightened me but,
>>> By the power of habituation,
>>> I will come to be disappointed at their absence.
>>> 7. Liberation of self and others from suffering
>>> Whoever wants quickly
>>> To protect himself and others
>>> Should practise the holy secret:
>>> Exchanging self and others.
>>> 1.	Out of attachment to one’s body, one is afraid of things which are not frightening
>>> 2.	Getting involved in all kinds of nonvirtue
>>> 1. Out of attachment to one’s body, one is afraid of things which are not frightening
>>> Out of attachment to my body,
>>> I am frightened by the slightest threat.
>>> Who would not resent as an enemy
>>> A body which creates so much fear?
>>> 2. Getting involved in all kinds of nonvirtue
>>> Wanting to alleviate the body’s
>>> Hunger and thirst, or its sickness,
>>> Someone kills a bird, fish or deer,
>>> Or lies in ambush by the roadside.
>>> For the sake of wealth and status,
>>> Someone kills his father and mother,
>>> Or steals the offerings made to the Three Jewels and,
>>> Because of this, burns in the Avīci Hell.
>>> Who, then, would be wise
>>> To cherish, protect and lavish gifts upon that body?
>>> Who would not see it as their enemy,
>>> And regard with contempt? 
>>> ‘If I give this, what will I have?’
>>> Thinking of one’s own benefit is the way of demons.
>>> ‘If I keep this, what will I give?’
>>> Thinking of the benefit of others is dharma of the gods.
>>> If I harm others for my own sake,
>>> I will be tormented in the hells and so forth but,
>>> If I am harmed for the sake of others,
>>> I will attain everything I could possibly want.
>>> If I desire a high status for myself,
>>> I will go to the lower realms, lowly and stupid but,
>>> If I wish it for others,
>>> I will obtain a happy rebirth and every honour.
>>> If I use others for my own sake,
>>> I will come to know servitude and so forth myself but,

If this body, which is for benefitting others and which has eyes and so forth for accomplishing the benefit of others, does something wrong to them, i.e. if it harms them and diminishes their virtues, that is inappropriate.

>>> How can I have no good qualities?
>>> Everyone has good qualities.
>>> Compared to some, he is inferior.
>>> Compared to some, I am superior.
>>> If he (one’s own stream of being taken as other) is thought of as having great qualities while I (the inferior person taken as self) am thought of as having no good qualities, I dispute this: how can someone have no good qualities? In other words, the inferior person (taken as self) must have good qualities. This thought constitutes envy.
>>> However, it is inappropriate to then think that the inferior one taken as self is contemptible since he has a degenerate view, moral conduct, etc.
>>> My degenerate view, moral conduct and so on
>>> Are not my fault but are due to the power of the defilements.
>>> They are not his fault; he is not autonomous. Why not? Because he is under the power of the defilements.

>>> He should do whatever he can to help me;
>>> I accept this may cause some pain.
>>> Even if taking the inferior one as self causes pain to one’s own stream of being (taken as other), this is acceptable. Alternatively, this means that although I (the inferior one taken as self) cause pain which establishes good qualities, I will accept this and will establish those good qualities.
>>> 3. Disregarding one’s good qualities which are unhelpful 
>>> Why does he not help me,

>>> I have a high status but others are low.

>>> Imperfection is in my nature,
>>> So don’t praise me for some accidental quality.
>>> Should I even have such a quality,
>>> Nobody needs to know about it.
>>> These verses taken in pairs of two lines indicate drawing attention to the reputation of others, working for others, giving up conceit in one’s own qualities and not drawing attention to one’s own qualities.
>>> In short, let whatever harm

>>> So it is you who will be subjugated.
>>> Having been given such advice, one should maintain control over the mind. If you, mind, do not practise accordingly, you will be subjugated, i.e. your compliance will be compelled by antidotes. Why? Because it is you who are the source of the faults. In what way?

>>> What is special about this particular lump?
>>> Why don’t I overcome pride?
>>> Turning to dust in the end is impermanence. ‘Unclean’ means emitting a foul smell. The inability to move means being material. Being moved by others means being intentionally moved. ‘Living or dead’ means the material substance is separate from mind. ‘Pride’ means having conceit in self and not holding onto that.

>>> 1. Distinguishing the two truths 
>>> Relative and ultimate: 
>>> These are asserted as the two truths. 
>>> •	Just as the relative is not to be found anywhere other than in seeing and hearing, likewise the ultimate would also not be found anywhere else. [380]
>>> Nor are they distinct dharmas which have an identical nature or substance, like the impermanence and composition of a vase, because the ultimate is not established as a substance. What are they then? They are like hairs appearing to pass across the sky and one thinking they are external. In this way, one cannot express the meaning of the distinction between the two truths as either identity or complete difference.2
>>> It is certain that truth and falsity are mutually exclusive. It is false that one can establish the existence of objects of conceptual discrimination with valid cognition. This is the relative. It is true that one can negate the existence of objects of conceptual discrimination with valid cognition. This is ultimate truth. Therefore, there are only two truths. 
>>> •	‘Relative’: the obscured objects of deluded conceptual thought.
>>> Ultimate truth is completely empty of deluded perceptions. Any kind of positive claim about it as existent, nonexistent, both, or neither, is a perception of deluded conceptual thought. Being completely distinct from that, it is unelaborated. The relative, appearing but untrue from the perspective of realization, is the perception of erroneous conceptual thought. 
>>> The ultimate is not within the domain of conceptual thought. 
>>> Conceptual thought is said to be relative.
>>> 1.	Distinguishing the types of conceptual thought
>>> 1. Distinguishing the types of conceptual thought 
>>> We can see two types of people: 
>>> Yogins and ordinary people.
>>> ‘Yogins’ are stream-entrants and those on the first bhūmi and above, who have achieved transcendental wisdom. ‘Ordinary people’ are those who have not seen reality—both the non-Buddhists, such as the followers of Kapila,6 and ordinary Buddhists.
>>> Ordinary, worldly people
>>> Worldly ones, such as those who hold the view of self, are opposed by those who, with the direct perception which sees non-self, cognize it is not true. Among these, ordinary worldly people are opposed by ‘worldly yogins’, i.e. śrāvaka yogins who see the self of dharmas. They in turn are opposed by the insight of yogins who see the non-self of subject and object—those who have the vision of mere discriminating awareness. They are opposed in turn by those [Madhyamaka yogins] who have the wisdom without dualistic appearances.7 
>>> Yogins, too, have distinct conceptual thought, 
>>> Why are ordinary people, who do not see reality, opposed by those with higher minds? It is because of the ascertainments of inferential reasoning made with those higher minds. Their inferential reasoning which refutes the self of the individual ascertains that the self and so forth, conceived of as objects by ordinary minds, are not established and their inferential reasoning which refutes the self of dharmas ascertains that there is no subject, object, nor mere discriminating awareness. How are these refutations made?
>>> Both agreeing upon examples, 
>>> That they are without intrinsic nature, like reflections.10
>>> ‘It is established that all conceptual thought—that of yogins and that of ordinary people—is deluded in regard to the nature of the relative and that there are objections between them. But if it established that all conceptual thought is deluded, those yogins who have exhausted delusion must have abandoned all conceptual thought by their ultimate realization of reality.’
>>> They do not abandon conceptual thought because they do not analyse, i.e. if one does not examine the conceptual thought, one will not abandon pleasant appearances. Why do they not analyse? To achieve results such as the perfection of the accumulations and the benefit of others. 
>>> Worldly people see existent objects
>>> And discriminate them as reality,
>>> Not as illusion-like. Therefore, on this,
>>> Yogins and worldly people are in dispute. 
>>> 1.	Distinguishing the types of conceptual thought 
>>> 1. Distinguishing the types of conceptual thought 
>>> We can see two types of people: 
>>> Yogins and ordinary people.
>>> Ordinary, worldly people
>>> Worldly people and non-Buddhists grasp many tiny atoms as a composite whole and take the stream of instants of cognition as a unified continuity. Since they are grasping at permanence, worldly yogins are opposed to them. These are śrāvakas who, with lower conceptual thought, have established tiny atoms and momentary instants of grasping. Furthermore, if one wonders whether there are objections among the conceptual thoughts of yogins, such as the śrāvakas: 
>>> Yogins, too, have distinct conceptual thought, 
>>> Both agreeing upon examples, 
>>> An extensive explanation of the differences among the conceptual thought of the [Buddhist] yogins will be given below [v6-56]. The objections to ordinary ones [i.e. non-Buddhists] will be taught in detail in the sections on the non-self of the individual [v57-110] and on the ceasing of grasping at existence [v111-150].18 
>>> ‘Are these refutations true in the Madhyamaka tradition or not? If the refutations are true, there is an infinite regress. If the refutations are not true, the Madhyamaka arguments would then be established as true, so there would be no delusion in such conceptual thought, and yet your position is that all conceptual thought is established as relative. This is a fault.’
>>> The non-empty would have to slightly exist.
>>> Emptiness would also exist.
>>> There is a difference:
>>> Worldly people see existent objects
>>> And discriminate them as reality,
>>> Not as illusion-like. Therefore, on this,
>>> Yogins and worldly people are in dispute. 
>>> Worldly people see existent objects with a non-comprehending cognition. Those who have such conceptual discrimination [387] conceptualize reality without understanding it as illusion-like. Yogins are distinct from this because they have such illusion-like understanding. Therefore, yogins and worldly people are in dispute, since the worldly cling to reality while yogins inferentially refute truly existent objects. 
>>> Although there is direct perception of forms and so forth,
>>> That is a consensus, not a valid cognition.
>>> It is a delusion to accord with a consensus
>>> Such as that something unclean is clean.
>>> This is existence by consensus, not by valid cognition. Although forms and so forth appear to be direct perceptions, such direct perceptions are designated by conceptual discrimination, just as appearances are only established by relative consensus and not by valid cognition of the ultimate. How so? In the direct perception of a vase, one cannot see the vase without seeing its interior or exterior etc. These conditions for what counts as ‘seeing a vase’ are a consensus in the world. It is similar with forms such as the so-called ‘silent subtle atoms of the eight substances’: we accept them, yet they are colourless and are not seen with the eyes. They only appear to the understanding and are established by consensus.
>>> Is this consensus ultimate reality? No, it is a delusion. For example, it is according to consensus that something unclean is clean and so forth.
>>> For the sake of introducing the worldly,
>>> The protector taught in terms of existence. In suchness,
>>> This is an intentional teaching. ‘Intentional’ means it has three factors: an intention, an intentional basis and a valid cognition which refutes the literal meaning.22 What is the intention? The Protector taught existence to allow worldly people to enter into the teachings. What is the intentional basis? [389] Relative existence. What is the valid cognition which refutes the literal meaning? [The following syllogism:]
>>> The skandhas and so forth are the logical subject. The probandum: they are ‘not really existent’ and are ‘not ultimate’. The reason: there is no momentariness, so what need to mention a corporeal existence? That is to say, there is not even an infinitesimal moment, so there cannot be something which is a composition of many of them. There is no single instant because it would comprise three parts—beginning, middle and end. If there were not these three parts, earlier and later would occur at the same instant and it would follow that even an aeon could be called an ‘instant’. As it says in the Ratnāvali, 
>>> ‘If momentariness is not ultimate, it must be completely nonexistent, for it is neither of the two truths: you Mādhyamikas do not allow moments as ultimate, for you do not allow an aggregate of past, present and future as ultimate, i.e. you do not allow a three-fold reality. Nor do you allow momentariness to be relative, for the relative appears even to the worldly and the worldly do not see the appearance of momentariness.’ 
>>> ‘This is incompatible with relative truth.’
>>> An aggregate of past, present and future is not ultimate but it is relative. There are two relatives: this is not the relative which is the conceptual thought of ordinary people, so there is no error. It is the relative of yogins. Since it is an object of the direct perception of yogins who see the truth and an object of analytical inference, it exists in the sense of appearing in that conceptual thought and hence there is no contradiction:
>>> There is no error, for it is the yogin’s relative.
>>> In comparison to the worldly, it is seeing reality.
>>> The claim that to see momentariness is to see reality means to see how things are in comparison to the deluded conceptual thought of worldly people.
>>> Otherwise, the ascertainment that women are impure 
>>> Would be refuted by the worldly.
>>> The merit in relation to the illusion-like Conqueror
>>> Is just as if he really existed.
>>> The cause of the arising of merit in relation to your real Buddha is the power of your faith in him. Just as faith arises for your truly existent Conqueror, so it also arises for the illusion-like one. It follows that his true existence is not the basis of merit.
>>> ‘If sentient beings are illusory, 
>>> How are they reborn after death?’
>>> For as long as the conditions are assembled,
>>> Even an illusion will continue to arise.
>>> How could sentient beings really be existent
>>> Just because their continuity lasts for a long time?
>>> A stream of being that persists from birth for a long time is not pervaded by being existent. Truth and falsity are not determined by a length of time because a year-old illusion can be designated as false while a day-old sentient being [392] can be designated as true. Therefore, future lives, etc. can be connected without being pervaded by existence. The pervasion25 is not established.
>>> When illusory beings are killed,
>>> There is no nonvirtue because they do not have minds.
>>> Merit and nonvirtue originate
>>> With those who possess an illusory mind.
>>> You accept that it is not nonvirtuous to destroy a heap of stones, while it is nonvirtuous to kill a person, for there is a difference in the existence or nonexistence of a mind. Similarly, though we assert that everything is like an illusion, when there is the illusion of mind-possession, we say that there is merit in the giving of food and nonvirtue in killing. If there is no mind, there is no nonvirtue or virtue in such things.
>>> Since mantras and so on do not have that power,
>>> Illusory minds do not arise from them.
>>> Having arisen from a variety of conditions,
>>> Illusions are varied too,
>>> But nowhere is there a single condition
>>> With the ability to create them all.
>>> ‘The ultimate is nirvāṇa.
>>> Saṃsāra is relative truth. In this way,
>>> If he is in saṃsāra despite being a Buddha, 
>>> What is the point of the bodhisattva conduct?’
>>> The objection: ‘The reality of one’s own mind is ultimate, which is naturally nirvāṇa even though one has not abandoned relative saṃsāra. If saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are therefore not mutually exclusive, although the Buddha’s attainment of buddhahood is nirvāṇa, it follows that it is also saṃsāra because saṃsāra is not distinct from the completely pure nature. According to this position, since the Buddha is in saṃsāra, practising the bodhisattva conduct is meaningless.’
>>> The response: although not distinct from the completely pure nature, in relative truth, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are distinct. Thus, where is the contradiction? The pervasion26 is not established. How are they distinguished in relative truth? They are distinguished according to whether or not the adventitious causes of the arising of the defilements have been exhausted:
>>> If the continuity of conditions is not interrupted,
>>> Even an illusion will not be dispelled.
>>> If the continuity of conditions is interrupted,
>>> It will not arise, even as relative.
>>> ‘The ultimate is nirvāṇa.
>>> Saṃsāra is relative truth. In this way,
>>> If he is in saṃsāra despite being a Buddha, 
>>> What is the point of the bodhisattva conduct?’
>>> ‘Thus, if nirvāṇa is ultimate and saṃsāra is the elaborations of the relative, [394] are dualistic appearances existent or nonexistent for the Buddha? If nonexistent, it would follow that the Buddha is nonexistent or an inanimate object.28 If existent, he is either relative or ultimate. If ultimate, it would contradict your previously stated position that “conceptual thought is said to be relative”. If relative, by the existence of the defilements in that relative, it would follow that Buddha is in saṃsāra. Therefore, what would be the point of the bodhisattva conduct?’
>>> The Prāsangika Mādhyamikas claim that the characteristics of relative and ultimate correspond with saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, respectively. Hence, their response is to say that the opponent’s premise—that the Buddha has conceptual thought with appearances—is not established in ultimate truth.
>>> If the continuity of conditions is not interrupted,
>>> Even an illusion will not be dispelled.
>>> If the continuity of conditions is interrupted,
>>> It will not arise, even as relative.
>>> With the signs of the vajra-like samādhi and the severance of the continuity of all conceptual discrimination, the continuity of the defilements is severed. By that severance, the continuity of actions is severed. By that severance, the continuity of conceptual thought with dualistic appearances is severed, so saṃsāra ‘will not arise, even as relative’. 
>>> If the continuity of conditions is not interrupted,
>>> Even an illusion will not be dispelled.
>>> If the continuity of conditions is interrupted,
>>> It will not arise, even as relative.
>>> ‘If even delusion does not exist,
>>> What perceives the illusion?’
>>> Since for you the illusion does not exist either,
>>> What do you perceive?
>>> The False Representationalist denies the illusions exist. Since, for them, mental representations are completely nonexistent and, since perception is pervaded by a perceptual object, it follows that there is no perception, for the perceptual object—the illusion—does not exist. Therefore, their objection is answered with the question, ‘Since for you there is no perceptual object—the illusion—what do you perceive?’
>>> ‘They exist as if they were external,
>>> But they are representations, which are mind itself.’
>>> ‘Reality is mind itself.’
>>> ‘Representations. A representation appears as something distinct but it is mind itself. Thus the perceptual object and the perceiver are not distinct and both exist [as mind itself]. Thus the response that applied to the False Representationalist objection does not apply here.’
>>> If the illusion is mind itself,
>>> Then what is seen by what?
>>> Can something be non-dual yet also self-aware? ‘Awareness’ is essentially characterized by the duality of agent and patient.34 It is pervaded by these two, like, for example, the chopping of wood with an axe. [397] If mind is non-dual, since there is no agent, the pervasion is established, just as, for example, a sword’s blade is unable to cut itself. 
>>> The protector of the world has taught
>>> That mind does not see mind.
>>> Is perception something separate from mind? What is perception? It is itself just mind. If a perception was perceived by another mind, there would be two minds. Therefore, if perception is mind itself, how can mind see mind? It is illogical to say that mind sees mind. For example, just as the blade of a sword cannot cut itself and a fingertip cannot touch itself, so mind cannot see itself.36
>>> Just as the blade of a sword
>>> Cannot cut itself…
>>> … so it is with the mind.
>>> ‘It is like a lamp—
>>> Self-illuminating.’
>>> That lamp could never be illuminated,
>>> For it was never cloaked in darkness.
>>> Since the lamp is not both the agent and patient of illumination, it is not pervaded by both. While the lamp is an agent of illumination, it is not the patient. Similarly, cognition is pervaded by both agent and patient—that which is aware and that of which it is aware, which cannot be the same thing. If the lamp were itself the illuminated patient, it would have to have been originally pervaded by darkness. It could not then also be the illuminating agent, which was never originally in darkness. 
>>> ‘The blue of a crystal, etc. depends on something external,
>>> While naturally blue objects do not depend on anything.
>>> Similarly, seeing is in some cases other-dependent,
>>> And in other cases, independent.’
>>> ‘Although duality of agent and patient generally exists, there is a counterexample in which there is non-duality. The blueness in something [translucent] like a crystal is seen in dependence on something blue external to it. This is a confirming example in which there is an appearance of duality in something non-dual. Blueness such as that of a lapis lazuli, however, does not depend on anything else. Similarly, in some cases, the object of awareness is something external, upon which the agent awareness depends, while in other cases, it is like the blue object and there is no dependence on an external agent awareness. Thus, not all awareness by seeing is pervaded by a separate agent awareness. By negating that an agent is aware of something external, the pervasion in your refutation of mere awareness is not established.’ [399]
>>> Something already blue 
>>> Cannot make itself blue.
>>> A lamp, when cognized by cognition, 
>>> But what do you claim cognizes
>>> The mind as ‘self-luminous?’
>>> If it is not seen by anyone,
>>> Is like the looks of a barren woman’s daughter—
>>> Discussing it is meaningless.
>>> In particular, it is meaningless to discuss whether it is luminous or not, for there can be no ascertainment of it in anyone’s understanding. Why? Because the general concept of ‘self-awareness’ lacks an intrinsic nature from which to draw the conclusion. An example of this is the looks of the daughter of a barren woman.
>>> ‘If self-awareness did not exist,
>>> How could consciousness be remembered?’
>>> ‘If the cause—self-awareness—did not exist, how could there be the result? Thus, from the reason of the effect—memory—self-awareness is inferred by the reverse pervasion.’
>>> The response: while memory is pervaded merely by having a preceding experience, it is not pervaded by self-experience, i.e. a memory comes from a separate experience connected with it. It is connected but is a separate experience.
>>> Memory comes from its connection to another experience,
>>> Like deducing a rat bite from an infection.
>>> An example is the poison of rat. Although one may not notice a rat bite which leads to an infection, one experiences a sensation of burning and, by connecting that to a rat’s poison, one becomes aware of the cause. Similarly, in remembering one’s earlier consciousness, although that consciousness itself is not experienced again, one experiences an object connected with it, and the memory arises in one’s cognition. Where is the contradiction? Thus, the pervasion39 is not established.
>>> 2. The error in the reason of its intrinsic nature
>>> ‘Since under the right conditions the mind can see
>>> That of others, how can it not see itself?’
>>> This logic is not certain, for it may be criticized as follows: if seeing something far were pervaded by seeing what is near, then if one saw a vase deep beneath the ground with an eye to which a magical eye lotion had been applied, it would follow that the eye, which is near, would also be seen. Yet, although one may see distant objects, one will not see the eye itself, smeared with eye lotion. Seeing far is not pervaded by seeing self and [401] so the reason is not certain: 
>>> Through applying the eye lotion of accomplishment,
>>> One will see a vase and not the eye lotion itself.
>>> Others explain this verse as follows: ‘The logical subject is a manifest object such as a blue object. This manifestation has the nature of cognition because the condition for such manifestations is either a cognitive condition, such as a sense power, or a mental condition, such as an inferential faculty. The pervasion is established, i.e. whatever arises merely from a cognitive condition is pervaded by the nature of cognition. Therefore, manifest objects are established as self-illuminated.’ Thus, it is objected:
>>> ‘Since under the right conditions the mind can see
>>> That of others, how can it not see itself?’
>>> In that case, it would follow that when the eye is smeared with magical eye lotion, the manifestation of the underground vase would also have the nature of an eye smeared with magical eye lotion because of its arising as a manifestation from that optical condition. If arising as a manifestation from an optical condition is not pervaded by the nature of the eye, arising as a manifestation from a cognitive condition is not pervaded by the nature of cognition, so the pervasion is not established:
>>> Through applying the eye lotion of accomplishment,
>>> One will see a vase and not the eye lotion itself.
>>> We may add that if the object—the blue manifestation—is established as having the nature of cognition by its manifestation from a cognitive condition, then the underground vase, being a manifestation from an eye lotion-condition, would also have the nature of eye lotion. If the vase does not have the same nature as eye lotion even though it is a manifestation from an eye lotion-condition, then likewise, the manifesting blue object would not have the nature of cognition even though it is a manifestation from the occurrence of a cognitive condition. Thus, self-awareness is not established. 
>>> ‘If cognitions were not real, there would be no direct perceptions such as seeing, hearing and so forth.’
>>> Cognitions of seeing and hearing
>>> Are not the objects of negation here.
>>> Here, we are preventing
>>> The cause of suffering: their discrimination as real. 
>>> Illusions are not other than mind
>>> If they were real, they would be other than mind but,
>>> If they are not other, they cannot be real.
>>> An illusion is not true, yet it is seen.
>>> So it is for the mind which sees.
>>> ‘Saṃsāra must have an existent basis. 
>>> ‘Just as a pile of stones is the basis for mistakenly thinking there is a person, delusion is pervaded by a basis of delusion. Therefore, because of the existence of the delusion of dual appearances, their non-dual basis—self-awareness—must exist.’ This is Ācārya Sthiramati’s objection, given as the reason clause of a svātantra.
>>> Otherwise, it would be like space.’
>>> If the nonexistent were to rest on the existent,
>>> Could it then start to function?
>>> It is untenable to say the reason40 is not established because it is accepted by both of us that the sights and sounds are nonexistent. It is untenable to say that the pervasion41 is not established, for if it were able to perform a function despite its being nonexistent, it would violate the premise [v27c] ‘saṃsāra must have an existent basis’, and its functioning would be indistinguishable from that basis. 
>>> Your mind would be unaided
>>> And completely solitary.
>>> Being free from dualistic perception,
>>> All would be the Tathāgata.
>>> So what is achieved
>>> By designating it mind only?
>>> Or, if mind is the Tathāgata from the very beginning, it is meaningless to accomplish buddhahood. 
>>> ‘How will your illusion-like understanding
>>> When an apparitional woman is conjured,
>>> Desire for her arises even in her creator.’
>>> That creator has not abandoned the imprints
>>> Of the defilements in her appearance.
>>> Thus, when he sees her,
>>> The imprints of emptiness are weak.
>>> [406] When the creator of the illusion—the illusionist—sees the woman, desire for her arises. Why? Because he has not abandoned clinging to the reality of cognizables. Why not? The imprints of emptiness are weak because karmic formations of perceptual objectification remain. Therefore, a partial understanding of illusion is not the path.
>>> By meditating on the imprints of emptiness,
>>> The imprints of reality will be abandoned.
>>> By meditating it is nothing whatsoever, 
>>> That, too, will then be abandoned,
>>> For when one thinks, ‘It does not exist’,
>>> There is no conception of an analysandum.
>>> Its unreality has then lost its basis,
>>> So how can it remain before the conceptual mind?
>>> When their unreality is before the conceptual mind, how can the objects of awareness remain? They cannot. Why? Because they have lost their basis, i.e. the conception of something to be negated, which is the basis of the conception of their negation. With no thought of something to negate, there is no thought of their negation.
>>> When neither existence nor nonexistence
>>> Remain before the mind,
>>> Since there is no other category at that time,
>>> There is a complete non-conceptual pacification.
>>> When existents no longer remain before the mind, the path of realization has not yet been established. It is established only when nonexistents also no longer remain before the mind and there is no establishment of a positive affirmation of nonexistence as an object of understanding. The general concepts of existence and nonexistence do not arise and since there is no attachment to their externality, there is complete pacification in non-conceptualization. With no conceptual imputation, the wisdom without dualistic appearances which cuts the continuity of conceptual discrimination arises.
>>> Just as wish granting jewels and wish fulfilling trees
>>> Fulfil hopes, 
>>> So, too, the conquerors appear
>>> By the power of trainees and aspiration prayers.
>>> The saṃbhogakāya appears to those who have mastered the tenth bhūmi and the nirmāṇakāya appears to ordinary individuals. What causes them to arise? They arise by the power of trainees and by the power of former aspiration prayers. How can they appear when they have no conceptual discrimination? In the same way that wish granting jewels and wish fulfilling trees fulfil hopes.
>>> For example, when the creator 
>>> Of a shrine of Garuḍa had passed away,
>>> The shrine still pacified poisons and so on,
>>> Long after his death.
>>> By holding the bodhisattva conduct,
>>> The shrine of the Conqueror is built,
>>> So even after the bodhisattva’s nirvāṇa,
>>> The benefit of others continues.
>>> Long ago, when the people of a certain place were afflicted by nāgas, Samgu,46 who had heard there was a woman in the land of Oḍḍiyāna with mastery of vidya-mantra, set out to visit her. He saw her collecting wood and, doubting her, respectfully asked her [408] about a method to control the nāgas. She proceeded to bless eight handfuls of milk from a black bitch with the vidya-mantra of Garuḍa. Samgu drank seven handfuls of milk but was unable to drink the last handful. Thus, seven of the eight nāgas were controlled but Ananta was not controlled. Although the people were then restored to health, Samgu later died from the afflictions of Ananta. Yet, a shrine he had consecrated with the vidya-mantra continued to pacify afflictions. Thus, just as illnesses, etc. were pacified by the shrine, following the bodhisattva’s nirvāṇa, even though his conceptual discrimination has ended, all benefits continue to be performed. If one asks why, it is because by following the bodhisattva conduct—the path of establishing the benefit of others—the shrine of the Conqueror is established.47

>>> In accord with this, since the Vedas and so forth are accepted by two tīrthikas, it would follow that they are also proven to be scriptural. 
>>> ‘But the Mahāyāna is disputed.’
>>> Your scriptures are also in dispute—with those of the tīrthikas,
>>> As well as with the other [śrāvaka] scriptures.
>>> Therefore, you should abandon them.
>>> Whether or not the Mahāyāna is the Buddha’s word, if it should be rejected because it is disputed, other scriptures even among the baskets of the śrāvakas should also be rejected because they are disputed, too. How are they are disputed? For tīrthikas, there is a dispute as to whether or not they are scriptures. Furthermore, disputations exist within the different śrāvaka schools. 
>>> ‘The root of the doctrine is monasticism.’
>>> It is difficult to be such a monk.
>>> The first four are not what is referred to here; rather, it is the arhat which is referred to, i.e. a monk who has abandoned the defilements. Why is the arhat the root of the doctrine? Because the arhat collects the doctrine, upholds the doctrine, disseminates it and so forth. 
>>> Why is this ‘difficult’ in the śrāvaka tradition? [412] Some say that if they do not meditate upon the emptiness which is the non-self of dharmas, then although there may be no direct causes of the defilements, their seeds still exist, since they still have incorrect mental activity. However, this is not the intended meaning of these lines. Śrāvaka arhats have not merely abandoned the direct causes [but have fully abandoned the defilements]. Otherwise they would not be distinct from the states of freedom from desire attainable on the higher worldly paths.53 They still have attachment to reality through the obscuration of cognizables, not of defilements. Therefore, since there is no possibility for the defilements to arise, they do not have the seeds of the defilements. Furthermore, if fully abandoning the defilements through the tradition of the śrāvakas were not possible, it would contradict v45d below which states that they do abandon the defilements. 
>>> From the point of view of the bodhisattva vehicle, the monk who has abandoned the defilements has exhausted all that is to be abandoned, i.e. all conceptual discrimination. He is the ‘root of the doctrine’ which the Buddha alone has demonstrated to others out of his own profound, complete enlightenment. In the śrāvaka tradition, it is difficult to attain liberation from the self-clinging to dharmas, without which one cannot attain buddhahood and so, lacking the cause of the final result, the śrāvaka tradition is of provisional meaning and not of definitive meaning.
>>> A nirvāṇa for the perceptual mind 
>>> Is also difficult to attain.
>>> [413] For the śrāvaka tradition, a nirvāṇa in which suffering is abandoned is not logical because the perceptual mind still has self-clinging towards dharmas. The existence of such a nirvāṇa is difficult for them to attain because their nirvāṇa is not free from the sufferings of a mind-made body. They assert a non-final nirvāṇa that is free only from the suffering in which the skandhas are still established but the nirvāṇa being referred to here [in the root text] is final. 
>>> 2.	The existence of the suffering of future lives
>>> ‘One is liberated by abandoning the defilements.’
>>> Then it would happen immediately,
>>> Yet one sees the power of karma
>>> Even though there are no defilements.
>>> In the nirvāṇa in which the skandhas remain, one can see the power of karma even though there are no defilements. One can see arhats such as Vibhudatta, for example, who experienced suffering.55 
>>> 2. The existence of the suffering of future lives
>>> ‘That is only temporary,
>>> For there is no direct cause—craving.’ 
>>> ‘Because they have no defilements.’
>>> Although they have no defilements, they have craving which is without defilements. How so? 
>>> They do have craving, though it is without defilements,
>>> For don’t they still have fundamental delusion? 
>>> They may have no defilements due to not grasping the self of the individual but, through the imprints of unawareness, they still grasp the self of dharmas. Therefore, they are still subject to nescience. Without the craving of attachment to the self among the skandhas, they have no defilements, but they still have the craving of direct attachment to mere dharmas. Thus, they still have the condition for the attainment of a mind-made body in future lives. 
>>> By the condition of sensation, there is craving,
>>> And they still have sensation.
>>> The objectifying mind
>>> For such people, still remains.
>>> Minds without emptiness
>>> May cease, but they will arise again,
>>> Like even settling without formations.
>>> Therefore, meditate on emptiness.
>>> One who has direct attachment to reality, even though their defilements may have ceased, will be reborn again. This is like entering into even settling without karmic formations, where even though the six groupings56 cease, their seeds are not overcome, so they likewise arise again.
>>> ‘That which is included in the sutra collection, appears in the vinaya and does not contradict the truth is pervaded by being the Buddha’s word. [415] This is how we establish the śrāvaka scriptural collections.’ 
>>> If you accept the words included in the sutra collection
>>> As the Buddha’s teachings,
>>> Why do you not accept the majority of the Mahāyāna
>>> Which is the same as your sutras?
>>> Due to a single point not being included,

>>> Due to a single point corresponding to your sutras?
>>> If the depths of these words were not fathomed
>>> Even by someone like Mahākāśyapa,
>>> Who should reject them
>>> For their not being understood by you? 
>>> For the sake of those suffering due to confusion,
>>> One remains in saṃsāra,
>>> But is freed from the extremes of desire and fear:
>>> This is the result of emptiness.
>>> By the cause—the delusion of confused ones—there is the result—suffering. Thus, one benefits others by remaining in saṃsāra for the sake of those tormented by these sufferings. This is the result which is the cognition of compassion and the illusion-like affirming negation. [416] Freedom from direct attachment towards the reality of things (desire) and being afraid of emptiness (fear) is the result which is the cognition of the non-affirming negation emptiness.

>>> 1.	How to engage in meditation on the non-self of the individual [v57-77]
>>> 2.	How to engage in meditation on the non-self of dharmas [v78-110]
>>> However, this is not correct. If one says that the foundations of mindfulness [v78-110] comprise the non-self of dharmas, it would contradict the Śikṣā-samuccaya, which says,

>>> It is neither the bones nor blood.

>>> Nor is it the lymph or pus.
>>> Self is neither the fat nor sweat.
>>> Neither the lungs nor liver are the self,

>>> Self is neither the excrement nor urine.
>>> Neither the flesh nor skin are the self,
>>> Nor are warmth or respiration the self.
>>> The orifices are not the self, 
>>> And none of the six consciousnesses are the self either. 
>>> The Sāṃkhyas assert that a primal matter exists universally in all beings. Containers of self-cognition and awareness exist within it as individual consciousnesses. Each of these has the inherent nature of a sempiternal, cognizing and aware self. When it has no appearances, representations [i.e. forms, sounds, etc.] remain within the mirror of mind.61 When it temporarily connects with manifesting representations such as the bare element of sound,62 it temporarily experiences objects.
>>> If the cognition of sound were immutable
>>> The sound would always be perceived.
>>> The logical subject is the individual consciousness. It must experience sound as immutable because it is a sempiternal sound-perceiving cognition. This position is untenable. By directly perceiving a single sound, it cannot perceive any other sound. It is untenable to say the reason63 is not established, for that would contradict the Sāṃkhya’s own proposition that the individual consciousness is sempiternal. 
>>> 1.	The violation of its intrinsic nature 
>>> 1. The violation of its intrinsic nature 
>>> If there is no cognizable, how is that awareness? 
>>> Why call this ‘cognition?’
>>> The first line is a question and the second is the response. The establishment of a sound cognition depends upon there being a sound. If there is no sound, there is no sound cognition. Similarly, since the nature of a sound cognition depends upon its cognizable, without a cognizable, there is no subjective cognition. Therefore, without a perception of sound, cognition is negated. Thus, our pervasion is established.
>>> If it were the case that the establishment of a cognition did not depend upon a cognizable, it would follow that even wood would count as cognition:

>>> 3.	It is unreasonable to call it the same thing
>>> ‘It is the same thing that cognizes form.’
>>> ‘Although cognition without a cognizable is impossible, when the sound is no longer in proximity, that very same cognition now cognizes forms. Since at that time the form cognizable exists, we maintain that cognition exists sempiternally.’
>>> Then why would it not also hear at the same time?
>>> If it is because no sound is nearby
>>> Then there is also no cognition of it.
>>> 3. It is unreasonable to call it the same thing 
>>> How can that which has the nature 
>>> Of sound perception perceive forms?
>>> It is unreasonable to designate incompatible representations as having a single nature. The establishment of a cognition of form in dependence upon a form cognizable has one nature and the establishment of a cognition of sound in dependence upon sound has another. 
>>> ‘An example of such a single nature that is non-contradictory is someone being established as a son in dependence upon his own father and the same person being established as a father in dependence upon having a son.’
>>> A single person might be called father and son,
>>> But his intrinsic nature is neither,
>>> Just as lightness, activity and darkness
>>> Are neither father nor son.
>>> To call a single person a father and a son is a worldly convention. Similarly, lightness, activity and darkness—the three ultimate natures [as posited by the Sāṃkhyas]—do not have the nature of either father or son.
>>> Nobody has ever seen

>>> Then it would follow that all beings are one.
>>> Sentient and insentient would also be one
>>> Because they are equal merely in being existent.
>>> If whatever shares the same qualification is pervaded by a single nature, then it would follow that the sentient—the individual consciousness, a cognizing awareness—and the insentient—primal matter and the mirror of mind66—have the same nature because they have the same qualification, being merely existent.
>>> If the instances are delusions,
>>> What common basis could they have?
>>> Something insentient is not the self,
>>> Because of its very insentience, like a vase.
>>> Because of its possession of a mind,
>>> [423] By owning a separate mind, either its material nature has changed or it has not changed. If it has changed, then having previously been material in nature, later it becomes an agent with intentionality. Thus, its previous material nature was impermanent:
>>> If it then cognizes, it follows that its non-cognition has been eliminated.
>>> ‘The self has not changed.’
>>> Then how did it become sentient?
>>> Thus, being non-cognizing and free from activity,
>>> Space would also be such a ‘self’.
>>> If the self has no nature of cognition nor is an agent, it follows that space is also a self.
>>> 3. Abandoning objections to non-self
>>> ‘If the self does not exist,
>>> A connection between actions and results is illogical.
>>> After performing an action, it is gone,
>>> So, for whom could there be karma?’
>>> ‘If the nature of self were not the same between this life and future lives, when the skandhas of this life and its karmic deeds are destroyed, the deeds would dissipate. Since the skandhas of the next life are newly arisen, they would not have any connection with the previous actions. Therefore, for whom could there be karma?’
>>> It is established for both of us
>>> That action and result have different bases
>>> And that a self does not have any role in this.
>>> So, is your objection here not pointless?
>>> ‘The causal agent is the recipient of its result.’
>>> No one ever sees this happen.
>>> Therefore, the karmic agent is the body of the causal agent and the experiencer of the result is the body of another person and these are distinct.
>>> It is just in dependence upon a single stream of being
>>> That the so-called ‘agent’ and ‘experiencer’ are taught.
>>> The past and future minds are not the self,
>>> Because they do not exist.
>>> If the arising mind were the self,
>>> Then when it ceased, there would be no more self.
>>> Past and future minds are not the self because the former has ceased and the latter has not yet arisen. Mind in the present moment, which has arisen but not yet ceased, is also not the self because it will cease to be. Since it becomes nonexistent, it does not have a sempiternal nature. The stream of being is nothing but a succession of many individual moments and has no real existence apart from this. 
>>> For example, if you split apart

>>> Similarly, if you search for it thoroughly,

>>> Compassion is for those imputed by confusion:
>>> They are accepted for the sake of the result.
>>> Why accept this delusion? It is for the sake of the result, i.e. we do not abandon others for the sake of benefitting them and attaining buddhahood, in accord with the earlier teaching on not abandoning conceptual thought with appearances.
>>> ‘If there are no sentient beings, who gets the result?’
>>> This is true but, nevertheless, they are accepted out of confusion.
>>> For the sake of fully pacifying suffering,

>>> Pride, the cause of suffering.
>>> ‘There is no way to resolve this [contradiction].’
>>> The meditation on non-self is supreme.
>>> This is not established because the supreme means for the attainment of buddhahood is meditation upon non-self. This is how Dānaśrī72 explains lines 77cd.
>>> This section is not a teaching on the four foundations of mindfulness taught elsewhere as the impurity of the body, the suffering of sensations, the impermanence of mind and the non-self of dharmas. However, one need not think there is any contradiction here to that teaching, only a different purpose. In our bodhisattva tradition, the purpose is to analyse the individual self for which grasping arises under the power of wrong views, by developing the characteristics of non-self in the meditative objects [i.e. the four foundations] to purify defilements. In the other tradition, since conduct degenerates under the influence of defilements such as attachment, one develops in one’s stream of being the characteristics of abandonment of the four wrong views73 as meditative objects to purify conduct.74

>>> ‘Suffering’ is the logical subject and ‘exists in reality’ is the reason. Since the nature of fire is to heat, [429] it cannot become cold. Similarly, beings’ minds abide in the nature of suffering, so it follows that there should not be even an instant of unadulterated happiness. But that is not the case; it is untenable, for it is contrary to direct experience. It is untenable for the reason not to be established, for it would contradict the proposition that suffering is existent. It is untenable for pervasion75 not to be established, for it would contradict valid cognition, just as fire cannot be cold. 
>>> If there is happiness, why are those afflicted by pain and so forth
>>> Not made joyful by sweetness and so forth?
>>> The bare element of the taste of sweetness is the logical subject. [Proposition:] It does not make those afflicted by pain joyful. [Contradiction:] It follows that they should be joyful because [Reason:] it has the inherent nature of happiness. The non-establishment of the reason, pervasion and proposition are all untenable, as in the previous section.

>>> If something is not experienced,

>>> ‘It is not experienced because of being overridden by the stronger force, like a daytime star.’ 
>>> The logical subject is this overridden experience. It follows that it is not a sensation because if something is not experienced, there is no experience. Since the experience is negated, the sensation has ceased. The proposition [that suffering is overridden] is untenable for it contradicts your premise [that suffering is sempiternal]. If the pervasion77 were not established, it would contradict valid cognition.

>>> Contact is the cause of sensation. From the connection of three things—object, sense organ and consciousness [431]—a perceptual object is classified as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. This causes happiness and so forth to arise. However, it is not logical that external objects make contact with sense organs:
>>> Is the gap between sense organ and object an existent thing or nonexistent? If existent:
>>> If an intermediary connects sense organ and object,
>>> Where do they make contact?
>>> The logical subject is sense organ and object. [Proposition:] These have an intermediary object. The reason is because something exists between them. [Contradiction:] Although the proposition is that they have contact, it follows that they do not have contact. 
>>> If there is no intermediary, they are unified.
>>> So, what has contact with what?
>>> If both positions [intermediary or no intermediary] and their reasons [something exists between them or they are unified] were not established, it would contradict the premise [that sense organ meets object]. If the pervasions79 were not established, it would contradict valid cognition.

>>> For they are identical in having no capacity.
>>> Although your position is that the particles—the logical subjects—make contact, it follows that one cannot impose upon the other because it has no interior capacity.
>>> ‘Although one does not impose upon the other, they do make contact. Where is the contradiction? The pervasion81 is not established.’
>>> Without imposition, they cannot combine.
>>> Without combining, they cannot make contact.
>>> ‘They make contact despite being partless.’
>>> How does this make any sense?
>>> Making contact with something partless:
>>> When you see it, will you show me?
>>> It is illogical to make contact with
>>> Consciousness, which is bodiless,
>>> And likewise for anything composite, because it is nonexistent,
>>> As was analysed previously.
>>> If there is no real contact,
>>> What are these sensations arising from?
>>> Why go to all this trouble?
>>> All this trouble for the sake of happiness is not sensible.
>>> One is not harmed by suffering.
>>> If the one who senses
>>> And the sensations themselves are nonexistent,
>>> Once this has been seen,
>>> How could craving not be dispelled?
>>> If the one who senses—the self—and the cause—sensations—are negated, then the effect—the craving of attachment to that—will be reversed.
>>> Even what is seen or touched
>>> Is itself dreamlike and illusion-like.
>>> Sensations are not perceived by mind,
>>> Because they arise simultaneously with it.
>>> If the former: the logical subject is the mind at the moment of the sensation. [Contradiction:] Although the proposition is that it experiences the sensation, it follows that it does not have the experience because they arise simultaneously. If one denies the establishment of the pervasion,83 it would contradict valid cognition because a perceived object must cause the perception. But here the pervasion of cause and effect is contradicted because the perceived object and perception occur in the same moment.84 
>>> Although something from before may be remembered after, 
>>> That is not experiencing it.
>>> A sensation cannot experience itself,
>>> Nor does anything else experience it.
>>> There is nothing existent that experiences sensations.
>>> Therefore, there are no sensations.
>>> Therefore, what could ever harm
>>> This selfless composite?
>>> Mind does not dwell in the senses,
>>> Nor in forms, etc., nor somewhere between these.
>>> Mind is not in the senses because it can exist even without the senses. It is not in the object because it can exist without an object. Nor is it somewhere between these because there would be no perception. [434] This shows that its basis is not established. To show that its nature is not established:
>>> Mind is neither the inner nor outer,
>>> Nor is it found anywhere else.
>>> It is neither within the body, nor apart from it.
>>> It is not combined, nor is it something distinct.
>>> Because such a thing does not even slightly exist,
>>> Sentient beings are by nature nirvāṇa.
>>> The sixth mind is not an inner sense organ, for it does not possess form. Nor it is an outer sense object, for it does not have a body, so it is not one of the five kinds of objects. Since it is not instantly ceasing, it is not a momentary dharma. It is not the physical basis of the outer or inner, since it does not have a body. It is not a combination of outer and inner, since they are mutually exclusive. It is not something distinct from these, since then there would be no perception. Therefore, it is inherently nirvāṇa.
>>> If the cognition exists before cognizable,
>>> What does it arise from?
>>> a) If consciousness existed before its cognizable, the following consequence would result. The logical subject is the cognition. It has no producer because a cognition before its cognizable has no preceding cause. It is untenable to say that the proposition and reason86 are not established, for that would violate your own premises. It is impossible that the pervasion87 is not established, for it would contradict valid cognition, as there is no effect without a cause.
>>> If cognition is co-emergent with cognizable,
>>> What does it arise from?
>>> If it exists after the cognizable,
>>> In that moment, what does it arise from?
>>> c) If the cognition arises after the cognizable, in the moment of cognizing, cognition and object are either temporally separated or temporally unseparated. If the former, because of their temporal separation, it follows that there is no product.88 If the latter, then either they are completely temporally unseparated or they are partially unseparated [435]. If the former, it follows that they are arising simultaneously, which is the same faulty position as b). If the latter, the cause is a composite being taken as singular and the effect is a composite being taken as singular, like a string of beads or an army taken as singular, in which case neither has an intrinsic nature, as was explained earlier.
>>> 1.	Establishing all as non-arising
>>> 1. Establishing all as non-arising
>>> Accordingly, all dharmas
>>> Should be understood as non-arising.
>>> ‘All dharmas’ is the logical subject. That they are completely non-arising is the probandum. ‘Accordingly’ indicates the reason by which the arising of all dharmas is not ultimately established. Why are they not established? It is due to the faults of an effect arising before, after and at the same time as its cause, which was explained in the previous section on refuting the perception of the five consciousnesses. 
>>> ‘In that case, there is not really any relative arising,
>>> So how can there be two truths?
>>> ‘If it is illogical for something ultimate to arise before its cause, at the same time as it, or after it and hence ultimate arising is illogical, then it is also illogical for something relative to arise before its cause, at the same time as it, or after it. Therefore, it follows that relative arising is also illogical. If this is your position, since there is nothing but ultimate truth, there cannot be two truths.’
>>> It might be responded that although the relative does not exist in someone’s undeluded conceptual thought, it does exist in someone’s deluded conceptual thought. [436] Therefore, it is logical to assert two truths when specified as such. But this is not the correct response. If it were, although the Buddha has no obscurations, it would follow that he still has obscurations due to anyone clinging to the existence of the appearance of obscurations in their deluded conceptual thought:
>>> If the relative exists [for the Buddha] due to others,
>>> How can sentient beings transcend suffering?’
>>> It is just the discrimination of those other minds.
>>> The relative is not [the Buddha’s] perspective.
>>> ‘Although it exists only from the perspective of someone’s delusion, that relative depends upon conceptual thought, which is not logical, for it is negated from the perspective of one who perceives its reality. Hence, there remains the error that two truths do not exist.’
>>> From the perspective of perceiving reality, when the logic that refutes ultimate arising is applied to relative arising, the error that the relative does not exist does not follow. We do not assert that there is arising before or at the same time as the cause, but we allow that there is arising after the cause. Likewise, we do not assert arising from a temporal separation of cause and effect, but we allow that there is arising from their non-separation. Likewise, we do not assert cause and effect are wholly unseparated, but we allow that they are partially unseparated, i.e. it is taking something composite as singular. This is a relative designation:
>>> If it is ascertained as arising after, it exists.
>>> If not, it does not have even relative existence.
>>> Therefore, ‘arising after’ means if an arising is ascertained as coming after its cause, the effect exists. An effect that does not occur before its cause is the deluded relative. We do not refute relative arising when the forward and reverse functions of cause and effect are established in this way.89 [437]
>>> ‘The non-arising of all dharmas could never be realized because, even if it were understood with conceptual thought, the subject itself would not have been understood as non-arising. In that case, there must be another understanding of that non-arising and so there would be an infinite regress.’
>>> The understanding and its analysandum
>>> Are mutually dependent.
>>> All analysis is expressed
>>> In dependence upon accord with consensus.
>>> If at that time there were an analyst
>>> Analysing the analysis
>>> Then there would be an infinite regress
>>> Because that analysis, too, would have to be analyzed.
>>> However, when the analysandum has been analyzed
>>> Then that analysis has no basis.
>>> Because it has no basis, it is non-arising.
>>> This is also called ‘nirvāṇa’.
>>> The inferential analytic ascertainment that the analysandum—all dharmas—has no intrinsic nature itself has no basis. Since that inference is itself included among all dharmas, it has no pervader which is a second inference. Just as when firewood is exhausted, the fire dies, so when objects have been negated, the subject is also negated a priori. Thus, the analysis itself has no basis and, with no basis, it is non-arising, which is also called ‘nirvāṇa’. 
>>> We do not deny all relative existence, such as the analysanda of conceptual thought which, with inferential reasoning, grasps the essential characteristics of conceptual objects, and general concepts. Thus, it is in dependence upon an analysandum that the conception of dharmas and dharma-possessors arises, as is explained in v108ab. 
>>> When it is directly ascertained that universally all dharmas have no intrinsic nature, that ascertainment is contrary to any individual case of an inferentially known intrinsic nature. Thus, it is ascertained a priori that no intrinsic nature is known inferentially. In other words, if it is understood that objects—the analysanda—are not established, then it is understood a priori that the analyst also has no intrinsic nature. Thus, it is not necessary to form this conclusion again with another inference, so there is no fault of an infinite regress, as presented in v110. The analysis has ‘no basis’ [v110c], i.e. the pervader is not supported. ‘It is non-arising’ [v110c] means that inferentially known existence is not ultimate. Being naturally ‘nirvāṇa’ [v110d] means that the obscurations of reality are not ultimate.91
>>> In that case, the existence of this pair
>>> Is a reality that is extremely difficult to maintain.
>>> What is asserted by realists—that both cognizable and cognition are true—is held as true without a valid proof. It is a designation of a reality that is extremely difficult to maintain. [440]
>>> 1.	Refuting the reason of mutual dependence
>>> 1. Refuting the reason of mutual dependence
>>> If objects are established from the sense powers,
>>> What supports the existence of cognition?
>>> ‘Cognition is established from the cognizable.’
>>> Then what supports the existence of the cognizable?
>>> If they are in mutual dependence,
>>> Then neither one exists.
>>> If there is no father without a son,
>>> Where does the son come from?
>>> There is no father without a son.
>>> Accordingly, neither of them exist.
>>> ‘When a sprout comes from a seed,
>>> We acknowledge the existence of the seed. 
>>> Since cognition arises from a cognizable,
>>> Why do you not acknowledge the cognizable’s existence?’
>>> When it is acknowledged the seed exists,
>>> That cognition is independent of the sprout,
>>> But what independently acknowledges  the cognition
>>> Comprehending the cognizable? 
>>> When the seed is established through its logical relation to the sprout, that establishment is comprehended by a consciousness which sees the sprout and which is independent of the sprout. If a cognizable is established by its cognition, it cannot be established until the cognition is established. What establishes that cognition? As shown above, a cognition that is aware of itself is illogical. A cognition established by the power of the established cognizable is also erroneous because they would be mutually dependent. [441] 
>>> The explanation of the qualification is taught by the Svātantrika founding fathers through the application of further syllogisms.98 Although their proofs by svātantra are indeed inerrant, establishing their pervasions, qualifications and so forth is very difficult, so those establishments will not be presented here. But if they are not established, are the syllogisms not incomplete? That may be so, but the three root syllogisms [not arising from self, other or without cause] do not actually appear in the root text, [442] so it was not the intention of the Ācārya to present the non-arising of dharmas in this way. Furthermore, if they were to be established, the appropriate place for that would be before lines 105cd: ‘Accordingly, all dharmas/Are not to be understood as arising…’, rather than here.99 
>>> 3.	Refuting arising from self
>>> Ordinary people can directly see
>>> Everything temporal has causes. 
>>> Differences such as in the segments of a lotus
>>> Are produced by different causes.
>>> ‘If different effects are created by different causes, what creates the different causes?’ 
>>> They are created by previous different causes:
>>> ‘What creates different causes?’
>>> They come from previous different causes.
>>> ‘Why is a cause able to produce its effect?’
>>> It comes from the power of a previous cause.
>>> ‘Is the effect before, at the same time as, or after the cause?’
>>> 3.	Effect after the cause
>>> The logical subject is the effect arising in a different moment. [Contradiction:] Although the proposition is that it exists before the cause, it follows that it does not exist before the cause because its cause does not yet exist. It is not tenable to say the proposition and the reason are not established, for it would contradict your own premise.100 [444] It is not possible for the pervasion101 to be unestablished: an effect without a cause cannot occur, for it would contradict valid cognition.
>>> 3. Effect after cause
>>> [Contradiction:] If the proposition is that the effect exists after the cause, [it follows that it does not arise from the cause,] because of being temporally separated from the cause. 
>>> Therefore, there is no arising from an impermanent other. Since this refutation accords with the logical subject of the earlier explanation of cognition arising before its cognizable [v104-105b], it is also established there and it is not necessary to further elaborate on it here.
>>> If Īśvara is the cause of beings,
>>> Please explain what the temporal Īśvara is.

>>> But why trouble yourself over a mere name?
>>> Furthermore, since the earth and so forth are multiple,

>>> Suitable to be trodden on and impure,
>>> They are not Īśvara.
>>> Space is not Īśvara because it is inanimate.
>>> The logical subject is space. That is not Īśvara because it does not have the sentience of intentionality. The reason here can be proven with the well-known inferences from other sources.
>>> He is not the self because that was refuted previously.
>>> Since it is inconceivable to describe
>>> A creator who is inconceivable, what would be the point of trying?
>>> What could he want to create anyway?
>>> Do you not claim that the self, the earth, etc.
>>> And even Īśvara’s own nature are sempiternal?
>>> Is Īśvara’s nature not sempiternal? Therefore, because both creator and creation are sempiternal, [446] it follows that all the effects created by him are contemporaneous with him. Yet, this proposition is refuted by direct perception. If the reason103 were not established, it would contradict your premise. 
>>> Cognitions arise from cognizables
>>> And beginningless happiness and suffering come from actions.
>>> So, what is it you say he has created?
>>> It is established by direct perception that impermanent objects arise from causes other than Īśvara. It is also established by direct perception that cognitions arise from their cognizables. It is established from both our scriptures that happiness and suffering arise from actions without beginning. Therefore, these all being the effects of Īśvara is negated.
>>> If the cause has no beginning,
>>> How can the effect begin?
>>> The logical subject is the effects of Īśvara, such as happiness and suffering. It follows that they sempiternally exist without any beginning because of their arising from a sempiternal, beginningless causal power. This proposition is untenable, for it contradicts your premise that the effects are temporary. It is untenable for the reason107 not to be established: if you say the cause is sempiternal, its power to create cannot later increase because, by your own claim, it is a primordial, beginningless causal power, as asserted in the qualification statement.108 
>>> How could his creations not be sempiternal,
>>> When he depends upon nothing external?
>>> The sempiternal cause is the logical subject. The probandum: ‘How could his creations not be sempiternal?’, i.e. he cannot create something temporal: because he does not depend upon external conditions, it follows that Īśvara’s state of creating is immutable. Therefore, being immutable, mutability is negated and hence the creations are contemporaneous with Īśvara. Thus, the pervasion is established.
>>> If there is nothing that was not created by him,
>>> What could he depend upon?
>>> 3.	He would be under the power of desire
>>> Would be the cause, not Īśvara.
>>> When assembled, he is powerless not to create,
>>> When absent, he is powerless to create.
>>> 3. He would be under the power of desire
>>> If Īśvara creates without wanting to,
>>> He is affected by an external power.
>>> If he creates when he wants to, the effect depends on his wishes.
>>> How then is he ‘The Almighty’ [Īśvara]?
>>> For those who assert sempiternal particles,
>>> The refutation was completed previously.
>>> The assertion of particles referred to here is the proposal of a substance as the ultimate cause by certain non-Buddhists, such as the Vaiśeṣikas. The refutation was previously completed in the section concerning the foundation of mindfulness of the body [v86], i.e. [they are not ultimate] because they are refuted by their decomposition into parts.
>>> 3. Refuting arising from self
>>> 2.	The error in that

>>> The position of the Sāṃkhyas is that
>>> The cause of beings is a permanent, primal substance.
>>> ‘The primal substance [1] is the sempiternal intrinsic nature. It is in a universal flow in which previously hidden manifestations can become manifest.109 This intrinsic nature is unseen due to obscurations. When manifestations arise from their previous state of non-manifestation, temporal objects are seen. Their cause is the intrinsic nature. Since both the intrinsic nature and what arises from it are in reality one, the primal substance is both cause and effect, but the arising of the manifestations is a relative [delusion].’
>>> 2. The nature of the primal substance
>>> Its qualities are ‘purity’, ‘activity’ and ‘darkness’.
>>> While they remain in equilibrium,
>>> They are called the ‘primal substance’.
>>> ‘The manifestations and sempiternal matter are pervaded by a oneness of the three qualities of the primal substance in equilibrium. This is the ultimate cause of all things. Individual consciousnesses [2] exist within that as containers of cognition and awareness. Each one is a sentient being experiencing objects. The individual consciousnesses are neither causes nor effects. [449] Since both the primal substance and the individual consciousnesses are ultimate, they are unseen, and are difficult to perceive.’
>>> Manifestations are said to be their disequilibrium.
>>> •	The conceptual mind [15]
>>> When there is equilibrium, happiness and so forth remain unmanifest within the primal substance. When there is disequilibrium, they become manifest. The five bare elements are then perceived as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Therefore, happiness and so forth are comprised of the material primal substance. When manifestations form in the mirror of mind [3], experiences arise through the combination of the inner cognizing awareness with those manifestations.’

>>> A triple nature that is also singular

>>> ‘Nevertheless, the three qualities exist.’
>>> The three qualities also do not exist
>>> Because each of them would also have three parts.
>>> The three qualities are also not real, [450] because there would have to be three parts to each of them, such as a purity of the purity and so forth. 
>>> Without the qualities, the existence of sound
>>> And so forth also becomes extremely implausible.
>>> Without the qualities, it follows that the elements such as sound would not exist because it is illogical to have the effect without the cause.
>>> Nor can the insentient, such as cloth,
>>> Contain pleasure and so forth.
>>> Material objects such as cloth, comprised of the five bare elements, are established by external perception, whereas pleasure and so forth are established by one’s inner awareness. That these are mutually exclusive is established by direct perception. Thus, the Sāṃkhya position is refuted for the wise by direct perception and refuted for the deluded by their never perceiving such an appearance [of e.g. cloth as containing pleasure].
>>> ‘When pleasure and so forth arise in the mirror of mind, it has a cause external [to the individual consciousness], such as the bare element of sound.’ 
>>> ‘They are caused by the substantial [bare elements].’
>>> Wasn’t the analysis of such substances already completed?
>>> If you propose that the five bare elements such as sound are the causes of pleasure and so forth, this would be a cognizable as the cause of cognition and the refutation for this was completed in the section on cognizable arising before cognition. According to the author of the Great Commentary, ‘completed’ here refers to the refutation of existence as atoms, as a composite and as a threefold nature.111
>>> Nevertheless, if you claim that the cause is the five bare elements and the effect is pleasure and so forth, you contradict your previous position that the primal substance with a threefold nature of pleasure, etc.112 is the cause and the five bare elements are the effect: 
>>> Also, the pleasure and so forth [in the primal substance] were your causes, [not the bare elements].113
>>> ‘We do not assert that the five bare elements are the causes of pleasure and so forth. The proposition is that the primal substance with the intrinsic nature of pleasure and so forth creates the five bare elements.’
>>> Cloth and so forth do not arise from pleasure and so forth. 
>>> Rather, pleasure and so forth arise from cloth and so forth.
>>> It is established by its incompatibility with direct perception that cloth and so forth do not arise from pleasure and so forth. Direct perception does not establish that cloth, etc. and the five bare elements arise from pleasure or the rest of the three qualities; rather, direct perception establishes the non-perception of pleasure and so forth arising from the five bare elements.114
>>> Apart from this, there is no pleasure and so forth.
>>> ‘We assert that the five bare elements are the causes and pleasure and so forth are the effects.’
>>> The five bare elements have been refuted as a reality. Pleasure, etc. do not exist as a reality because they are relative.

>>> ‘They become subtle.’
>>> How can something gross also be subtle?
>>> ‘It becomes subtle by the elimination of the gross.’
>>> Then the gross and subtle states are both impermanent.
>>> ‘Gross and subtle are contingent states and the intrinsic nature of each state is distinct.’
>>> 4. Establishing the primal substance as impermanent115
>>> ‘The contingent states are impermanent, but the primal substance is permanent.’
>>> In this way, why not accept
>>> That all such things are impermanent?
>>> If the gross state is nothing other than pleasure,
>>> The impermanence of pleasure is evident.
>>> The primal substance of the three qualities (pleasure and so forth) is the logical subject. ‘Its impermanence is evident’ [in 134b] is the probandum. [The reason:] line 134a, i.e. because it is identified by its gross and subtle impermanent states, like a vase being identified by its blueness. Therefore, if it is established that the primal substance has impermanent states and that these are the intrinsic nature of everything, it is established that all dharmas are impermanent.
>>> ‘At the earlier time when the Sāṃkhyas’ five bare elements are not manifesting, their subsequent state still exists within the primal substance, and later manifests. When there is a lump of clay, the pot is contained within that substance but is not manifest. It is later made to manifest by the potter and so forth. Therefore, only its nature as an effect arises but nothing arises which was not previously present. It does not newly arise.’
>>> ‘Whatever does not already exist
>>> Cannot arise because of its not existing.’ 
>>> ‘The formerly nonexistent thing is the logical subject. It cannot arise subsequently, [453] because the former does not exist, just like, for example, the horns of a hare not existing in the clay cannot arise. The former thing is nonexistent, so if it could arise, the horns of a hare also could arise from clay, but they cannot arise.’
>>> By the reason ‘[because of] its former nonexistence’, you establish that there is no subsequent arising. Therefore, when your contingent state of pleasure and so forth manifests, that is also a latter arising from a nonexistent former, which you say is not established:

>>> If the worldly person does not have valid cognition, he could not experience [454] any manifest effects. If he did see them, they would be false. 
>>> ‘If valid cognition is not valid,
>>> Are its analyses not false?
>>> 1) ‘You Mādhyamikas hold that conceptual thought is relative. If this thought is deluded, it follows that even inferential valid cognition which cuts off elaborations is delusion.’
>>> 2) ‘If the primal substance etc. were not real, since a refutation depends upon something to be refuted and since the object of refutation is not real, it follows that emptiness, which refutes it, is also not real.’
>>> If reality is emptiness,

>>> With no connection to an object of examination
>>> There is no grasping of its nonexistence.
>>> Therefore, whatever the false object may be,
>>> Its nonexistence is clearly false.
>>> Since all conceptual thought is in error, it is not valid cognition. Nor are its objects—the objects to be refuted—established. Therefore, the emptiness which negates them—the emptiness being affirmed—is itself an untrue analysandum and is also not a valid cognition. This is the meaning of ‘its nonexistence is clearly false’. Grasping the negation of the object of negation is false. Why? That conceptual thought [455] has no connection to an analysandum—the object to be examined, i.e. in not fabricating an analysandum as an object of conceptual thought, there is no grasping of its nonexistence. No conceptual thought of the negation arises. 
>>> When the son dies in a dream,
>>> The discrimination that ‘he does not exist’
>>> Counters the discrimination that he exists,
>>> Even though it is false.
>>> If the son within a dream is false, the discrimination that, ‘Now he has died, so he does not exist’ is also false. Nevertheless, it counters the discrimination that he exists. It functions as an antidote to the imputation that grasps him as existent, in respect of which it is not a delusion. In the same way, the explicit predicate ‘[it] is empty’ negates the object to be negated. Although that positive affirmation of the emptiness of the external object of attachment is itself false, it overcomes the possibility for imputations to arise which could be grasped as existent. In respect of its eliminating imputations grasped as existent, there is no contradiction with the merely analytical aspect of valid cognition. This is the Svātantrika Madhyamaka argument.119 If one applies the Prāsangika Madhyamaka explanation, ‘it is false’ means it is the yogic relative, by which the erroneous understandings of others are refuted.

>>> ‘It is fabricated, like a reflection’ [144c] indicates that if something has an intrinsic nature, then it is illogical for it to be fabricated by causes and conditions, since what arises from causes and conditions is pervaded by fabrication. Since that is contrary to its reality, it negates its reality. Thus, the negandum—its reality—is pervaded by non-fabrication. Since the contrary—fabrication by conditions—is supported by the logical subject, the contrary pervader is supported. [457]

>>> Those who have not realized emptiness but want happiness have great difficulties in just getting by, with terrible sufferings in this very life. Why are virtuous actions so difficult? Because of nonvirtue. In what way? [461] By the cause of conflict with enemies, anger and intense malice are created. From that comes fighting, arguing and cutting and stabbing one another. Thus, nonvirtues arising from anger are accumulated. By the cause of excitement towards friends, when one is with them, hysteria, fighting and arguing develop and when one is not with them, misery develops. Thus, the nonvirtues which arise from these are accumulated.
>>> 1.	The sufferings of the lower realms
>>> 1. The sufferings of the lower realms
>>> Having enjoyed so much happiness,
>>> In happy rebirths again and again,
>>> After death, it ends, and one suffers,
>>> Falling into torment for a long time.
>>> Having had happy rebirths again and again, one falls from them. When? At death. Where does one fall to? To the unbearable sufferings of the lower realms, which are difficult even to think about. For how long? For a long time.
>>> Within conditioned existence, there are many precipices,
>>> For there is no truth in it.
>>> Where there is conditioned existence, there is no reality,
>>> For they are incompatible.
>>> There being no reality means that, since there is no wisdom of realizing suchness, grasping at existence is not pacified, so the root of suffering is not pacified. Why is there no wisdom of realizing suchness? Because of its incompatible condition, i.e. the existence of its opposite. What is that? The many precipices of affliction by suffering. They are the effects, while non-truth—the obscuration of ignorance—is the cause. [462]
>>> There is no way to truly exemplify
>>> This unending ocean of unbearable suffering.
>>> It is where we lack strength.
>>> It is where life is short.
>>> It is where we are worn out, striving to live and get by,
>>> Where we are exhausted by hunger and sickness,
>>> Where we sleep and where we cause harm,
>>> And where we meaninglessly associate with the childish and with friends.
>>> So life swiftly passes by without any meaning,
>>> And a remedy is extremely difficult to find.
>>> How can we find a way
>>> To dispel habitual distraction?
>>> Why can we not dispel it? Because the remedy—the antidote—is extremely difficult to find and because of disturbing and mistaken habitual distractions. Why is the remedy difficult to find? Because our exertion for it is weak, so we are lacking in strength, and this opportunity is unstable, so life is short. Why are there habitual distractions? Because we are worn out by striving to live and get by, exhausted by hunger and sickness and because we pass our time meaninglessly with sleep and harmful things and are occupied meaninglessly with childish people and friends, so this life passes by without meaning.
>>> It is where demons are striving to cast us
>>> Into the great lower realms.
>>> In conditioned existence, demons are striving. For what purpose? To cast us into the lower realms. [For example], the demon Kāmadeva fired his flower-arrow at Queen Padmavati and so forth.128
>>> It is where overcoming doubts is hard
>>> Among its many mistaken paths.
>>> An opportunity like this will be difficult to find again,
>>> After transmigration from this life, such an opportunity will be difficult to find again. There will be no return of the eight freedoms and the five endowments of oneself will be difficult to find. 
>>> And the presence of Buddhas will be extremely difficult to find.
>>> It is difficult to escape the river of defilements.
>>> It is difficult to escape the river of attachment, craving, views and unawareness. Therefore: [463]
>>> Alas! The suffering just goes on and on.
>>> Although the sufferings are intense,
>>> Some cannot recognize their own misery.
>>> Alas! It is only right to feel pity
>>> For those who dwell in the rivers of suffering.
>>> This is like, for example, bathing again and again,
>>> And then stepping into a fire again and again,
>>> Proclaiming one’s happiness,
>>> While being in immense pain.
>>> Bathing and then entering a fire is explained by the author of the Great Commentary as someone being submerged in painfully cold water and then, wishing to be warm, stepping into a fire.129 Others say it is a reference to an actual yogic practice of certain tīrthikas.
>>> So, carrying on as if
>>> There were no old age or death,
>>> They are first subjected to death
>>> And then fall into the unbearable lower realms.
>>> Those who assume they will not grow old or die will die and be reborn in the lower realms. Thus, if one has not realized emptiness, those sufferings will arise but, if one realizes it, they will be prevented. 
>>> 2. Benefit of others
>>> 1.	Pacifying suffering
>>> 1. Pacifying suffering
>>> When will I be able to pacify
>>> These unbearable fires of suffering
>>> With a rain of accumulated happiness
>>> Falling from clouds of stored up merit? 
>>> Having fostered the non-conceptual
>>> And devotedly accumulated merits,
>>> When will I show emptiness
>>> To those lost in conceptualization?
>>> Who does one do this for? For those who are lost in conceptualization. From what cause will their benefit come? From reliance upon the non-conceptual—the accumulation of primordial wisdom—and from devotion to the gathering of merit—the accumulation of merit.
>>> According to this explanation, the dispelling of the sufferings mentioned above [v154c-165] refers to the benefit of self. This explanation does not fit the root text in one respect. [464] For one who has not realized emptiness, does the ‘suffering’ refer to suffering experienced by self or by others? If the former, verses 166-7 also refer to one’s own suffering, so they are part of the section on the benefit of self. If the latter, even if dispelled, v154c-165 refer to the suffering of others, so should not be included in the benefit of self. Therefore, the sections on the non-establishment of the worldly dharmas and ending conditioned existence together comprise the result of realizing emptiness and what follows concerns the benefit of others, which goes from v154c through to v165 in accord with the previous explanation, then dispelling suffering is v166 and the means to dispel it is v167.

>>> Whose power clears away the enveloping darkness, bringing joy and happiness?’
>>> When they look up, may they see the blazing form of Vajrapāṇi in the sky,
>>> And the power of their intense joy clearing away all negativities, may they go to join him.
>>> Seeing the glittering fires of hell
>>> Extinguished by rains of flowers mixed with scented water,
>>> May they wonder what could have brought such happiness,
>>> And may these denizens of hell see Padmapāṇi himself.
>>> ‘Friends, come here quickly. Don’t be afraid.
>>> He forcefully dispels all our suffering and brings the power of joy!
>>> A protector of all beings, who has generated bodhicitta and kindness,

>>> Upon seeing Mañjughoṣa, may the denizens of hell cry out in joy.
