d) By arguing that particles are too small to be observed and therefore their contact or non-contact cannot be determined
ANSWER: c

Q355. Why is consciousness unable to make contact with anything, according to verse 9.96?
a) Because consciousness is identical to the objects it perceives and therefore cannot make contact with what is already itself
b) Because consciousness is bodiless and without physical form, making physical contact logically impossible for it
